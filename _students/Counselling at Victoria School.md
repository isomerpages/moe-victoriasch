<p><strong>What is counselling?</strong></p><p>Counselling is a process that focuses on enhancing the emotional, behavioural and psychological well-being of the client, such that the client is then able to reach their full potential. This is achieved by the counsellor facilitating your personal growth, development, and self-understanding, which in turn empowers you to adopt more constructive life practices.</p><p>Counselling may be helpful in a number of ways. It can enable you to develop a clearer understanding of your concerns and help you acquire new skills to better manage personal and educational issues. The counsellor can offer a different perspective and help you think of creative solutions to problems. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone not personally involved in your life can be most helpful.</p><p> </p><p> Ms Lim In Siew</p><p>Mr Tan Teck Chou Daniel</p><p>Mr Noor Sukhairan B Tugiran</p><p>Mr Gordon Oei</p><p>Ms Nur Fadhilah Binte Roslan Samat</p><p>Ms Atiqah Ibrahim</p><p>Mdm Norlinsah Bte Ismail</p><p>Special Education Needs Officer: <br>(Learning &amp; Behavioural Support)</p><table><tbody><tr><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>School Counsellor:</p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Mdm Tasmine Tham</strong></p></th><th rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></th></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p><strong>Teacher Counsellors:</strong></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>f</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Please visit <a href="https://victoria.moe.edu.sg/students/counseling-at-vs/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://victoria.moe.edu.sg/students/counseling-at-vs/</a> for more information.</p><p>If you need to speak with a counsellor, kindly call the General Office at</p>
