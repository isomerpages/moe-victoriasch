<p><strong>What is counselling?</strong></p><p>Counselling is a process that focuses on enhancing the emotional, behavioural and psychological well-being of the client, such that the client is then able to reach their full potential. This is achieved by the counsellor facilitating your personal growth, development, and self-understanding, which in turn empowers you to adopt more constructive life practices.</p><p>Counselling may be helpful in a number of ways. It can enable you to develop a clearer understanding of your concerns and help you acquire new skills to better manage personal and educational issues. The counsellor can offer a different perspective and help you think of creative solutions to problems. Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone not personally involved in your life can be most helpful.</p><table><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>School Counsellors:</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Tasmine Tham</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Teacher Counsellors:</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Ms Lim In Siew<br>Mr Tan Teck Chou Daniel<br>Mr Noor Sukhairan B Tugiran<br>Mr Gordon Oei<br>Ms Nur Fadhilah Binte Roslan Samat<br>Ms Atiqah Ibrahim<br>Mdm Norlinsah Bte Ismail</p></td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Special Education Needs Officer:<br>(Learning &amp; Behavioural Support)</p></td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1"><p>Mdm Alia Jalal</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>If you need to speak with a counsellor, kindly call the General Office at 6291 2965 for assistance.</p><p><strong>Stress Management Tips</strong><br><strong>Tips from Student Care Services</strong><br>1.
