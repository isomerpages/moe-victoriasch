# **Secondary 1 Registration 2022**

**Dear Students who are Posted to Victoria School,**

1\.  Congratulations on your successful admission to Victoria School (VS)!

2\.  We welcome you to the school and are glad that you are now a member of the Victorian Community. Our vision is that every Victorian will become a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman. In line with our emphasis on holistic values-driven education, you will have many opportunities to experience, develop, grow and excel (EDGE) in curricular and co-curricular activities.

**Administrative Matters during Secondary/Year 1 Registration**

Entry into the school

3\.  Students are **not** required to physically report to their posted secondary school on the next working day following the release of S1 Posting Results. However, we recognise that you may still need to come to school before school re-opens.

4\.  Please book an appointment to purchase school uniform, PE attire, textbooks and student journal via this [link](https://www.picktime.com/popularschool) or QR code below. Refer to booklist on point number 24 below for the instructions.

**Traffic Arrangements when School Re-opens**

9\.  On days with **good weather**, parents’ vehicles will not be allowed to enter the school campus to drop off their son. This is to ensure safety of our students who are walking into the school. **Students who take their parents’ car to school** should alight at the drop-off bay just before Gate 1a at Siglap Link.  After being dropped off, Victorians should walk and enter the school via the pedestrian path alongside Gate 1a. Please refer to school website or facebook for latest update on traffic arrangements nearer to the school re-opening date.

10\.  For **students who take bus to school**, they should enter the school via Side Gate A or Side Gate B, The additional gate next to Side Gate A will be open to ease human traffic during morning school hours (Mon, Tue, Wed & Fri - 6:30am to 7:35am; Thu - 7:30am to 8:35am).  This gate will be manned by a school staff to ensure school security when it is open.

11\.  On **wet weather** days, parents’ cars may enter via Gate 1a. Parents should drop their sons at the school foyer, and exit via Gate 2. Please follow the traffic directional signs and drive slowly within the school compound.

**Deemed Consent for Use of Photographs or Video Images**

12\.  Photographs or video images of students may be taken during school activities and events. The school may use and publish such photographs, or video recordings in school publications, the school’s website, social media channels or other communication channels.  Please email to the school ([**victoria\_sch@moe.edu.sg**](mailto:victoria_sch@moe.edu.sg)) if you do not give consent.
