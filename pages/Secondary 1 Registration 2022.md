**Traffic Arrangements when School Re-opens**

9\.  On days with **good weather**, parents’ vehicles will not be allowed to enter the school campus to drop off their son. This is to ensure safety of our students who are walking into the school. **Students who take their parents’ car to school** should alight at the drop-off bay just before Gate 1a at Siglap Link.  After being dropped off, Victorians should walk and enter the school via the pedestrian path alongside Gate 1a. Please refer to school website or facebook for latest update on traffic arrangements nearer to the school re-opening date.

10\.  For **students who take bus to school**, they should enter the school via Side Gate A or Side Gate B, The additional gate next to Side Gate A will be open to ease human traffic during morning school hours (Mon, Tue, Wed & Fri - 6:30am to 7:35am; Thu - 7:30am to 8:35am).  This gate will be manned by a school staff to ensure school security when it is open.

11\.  On **wet weather** days, parents’ cars may enter via Gate 1a. Parents should drop their sons at the school foyer, and exit via Gate 2. Please follow the traffic directional signs and drive slowly within the school compound.
