IP students are to report in VJC uniform.<br><br>Grooming must be befitting of a Victorian (i.e. No outlandish hair style or dyed hair). Failing to obey the grooming requirement, you will be served last or might be asked to come back to school the next day to get your results. Please settle all outstanding school fees with the General Office and return all items loaned from the school (e.g School Blazer) before 1.30 pm on Thursday.<br><br>Students who are unable to collect their results in person should inform the school and can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results.
