# **E-Learning Day on Thu 8 March 2018**

Dear students / parents,

As part of the school’s continual effort in infusing ICT into teaching and learning and also for emergency planning and preparedness, the school will be having e-learning day for all students on **Thu, 8 March 2018**.

Students need not report to school and will be required to do online learning tasks and assignments from home via our school’s Learning Management System (LMS).  The schedule is posted in LMS.

Students with no access to computers or the internet at home may use the school library’s computers during e-learning day.
