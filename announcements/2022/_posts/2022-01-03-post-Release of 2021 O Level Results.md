Dear Victorians of Class 2021,

The results of the 2021 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examination will be released on 12 January 2022, 2.00pm.

Given the COVID-19 situation, the school has made arrangements for you to receive your results in the respective venues.

4A:  AV Room 1

4B:  AV Room 2

4C:  Seminar Room A

4D:  IT Lab 1

4E:  IT Lab 2

4F:  Professional Room 1

You are required to be seated in the respective venues by 1.30 pm for important JAE briefing before the release of your results at 2 pm.

The attire for the O Levels students for this important day is VS uniform with approved shoes. IP students are to report in VJC uniform.

Grooming must be befitting of a Victorian (i.e. No outlandish hair style or dyed hair). Failing to obey the grooming requirement, you will be served last or might be asked to come back to school the next day to get your results.

Only students collecting results will be allowed entry into the school premises, and students will be expected to observe the Safe Management Measures (SMMs) in place.

Students issued with the Ministry of Health's Health Risk Warning will be allowed to collect their results in person if they test negative using the Antigen Rapid Test (ART) on the day of the results release before going to school.

Students who are unwell or are required to self-isolate due to a positive COVID-19 test result should not return to school to collect their results. These students may check their results online via Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board’s (SEAB) Candidates Portal at www.seab.gov.sg from 2.45pm on 12 January 2022. Students who are eligible for Singpass can use their Singpass account to access SEAB’s Candidates Portal. Students who are International Students will receive their system-generated username via email from 7 January 2022. SEAB’s Candidates Portal will be accessible from 12 to 26 January 2022.

Students who are unable to collect their results in person should inform the school and can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their results on their behalf. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents for the school’s verification when collecting the results.

Students may contact the school for assistance if they are unable to appoint a proxy, or if they have not received their system-generated username for SEAB’s Candidates Portal.

Wishing you all the best!
