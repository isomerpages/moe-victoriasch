# **9th National Patrol Camp – Scouts – Gold Award**


![](/images/Scouts-2.jpg)

We are proud to share that our Arrow Scouts achieved the Gold Award at the 9th National Patrol Camp.

Well done, Victorians! We are proud of you, and we hope the learning was meaningful throughout the whole process.

We would also like to thank our teachers-in-charge and adult volunteers who spent time training and mentoring our Victorians. Without you, the team would not have gone so far in the competition.

Nil Sine Labore. Viva Victoria!
