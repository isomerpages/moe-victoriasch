We are pleased to share that Victoria School has been conferred the School Distinction Award, along with 5 Best Practice Awards, by the Ministry of Education in 2016.

The 5 Best Practice Awards are for:  
1) Teaching and Learning  
2) Character and Citizenship Education  
3) Student All-Round Development  
4) Staff Well-Being and Development  
5) Partnership

The quintessential Victorian experience is premised on character and leadership excellence. We nurture every Victorian to be a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman. The awards are a testament to our commitment towards the holistic development of every Victorian, our focus on staff well-being and development, and our emphasis on partnerships.

As a school with 140 years of history, we have grown from strength to strength. Our achievements today are the result of the hard work by successive generations of school leaders, staff and Victorians. As we end 2016, we would like to extend a big thank you to our past and current school leaders, staff, students, OVA and alumni, PSG and parents, Victoria Advisory Committee (VAC), voluntary adult leaders who help out in our Uniformed Groups, and our partners for the great work and support for the school.

Nil Sine Labore. Viva Victoria!
