Congratulations to our Cricket team! We are National 3rd!

Our C Division Cricket team played against St.Patrick's School in the National C division Cricket Tournament held at Ceylon Sports Club on Wed, 24 Aug. St.Patrick's won the toss and elected to field first. Captain Chandramouli and Vice-Captain Yashaswi opened the innings and gave a good start for our team supported by Aryan, Bhadran. Eventually after 20 overs we were 173 for 7 wickets with Captain Chandra hitting a half-century. In response, St.Patrick's managed to score 75 runs in 20 overs for 8 wickets.

With this, we have achieved National 3rd in the 2016 National Schools Cricket Tournament. Well done, Victorians! We are proud of you and the team's achievements.

Continue to aim high, work hard and train hard as a team. Live like a GPS, be engaged and committed to excellence in what you do, and keep our school flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore. Viva Victoria!
