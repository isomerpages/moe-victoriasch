# **Appreciation of Staff**

![](/images/VS-Appreciation.png)

Throughout your son’s experience at Victoria School, he would have encountered many occasions when our teaching/non-teaching staff went out of their way to develop him into a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman. The staff member might have also worked closely with you in supporting your son’s development at VS. If you would like to write a note of appreciation for the staff member, please visit [https://go.gov.sg/vsappreciation](https://go.gov.sg/vsappreciation) or scan the QR code to send your note of thanks to him/her. Your note will certainly encourage our staff to continue doing the good work that they have always been doing.

Thank you!
