**Welcome to VS Open House**  
Established in 1876, Victoria School is known for the focus on character and leadership.  We nurture every Victorian to be a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman who makes tangible contributions to his family, work, community and nation.

At our Open House, immerse yourself in the Victorian Experience and discover how our broad-based and holistic Victorian Education develops every Victorian to his full potential.  Walk around our campus with our student guides, explore the engaging and unique programmes, and chat with our dedicated teachers to find out more about what we do.

**When is it?**  
Saturday, 25 May 2019, 8.00am – 1.00pm

(Note: Victoria School will have only one Open House in 2019.)

**Where will it be held?**  
Victoria School, 2 Siglap Link, Singapore 448880

There are limited car park lots in the school. Parking will be on a first-come-first-serve basis. If the car park is full, visitors will be directed to park at the public car parks near the school.

(\*The nearby public car parks are at Car Park E1 in front of East Coast Seafood Centre, and the car park along Upper East Coast Road which is next to Shell Station. These car parks are about 10 minutes’ walk from Victoria School.)
