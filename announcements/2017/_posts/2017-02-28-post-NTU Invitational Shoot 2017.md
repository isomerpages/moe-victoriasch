Our Shooting Club members participated in the NTU Invitational Shoot 2017 on 2-3 March.

The team clinched 1st place for B Division Air Pistol Team Category and C Division Air Rifle Team Category. Poh Yu Hao (4C) and Joshua Tan Le Jin (1H) also placed first for B Division Air Pistol and C Division Air Pistol individual category respectively.

Well done, Victorians! We are proud of you. Continue to train hard for the National School Games. Keep our VS' flag unfurled.
