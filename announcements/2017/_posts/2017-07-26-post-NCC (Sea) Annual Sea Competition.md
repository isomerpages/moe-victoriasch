We congratulate our NCC (Sea) unit which achieved the following:

2\. Kayaking Doubles Overall Champion (S1 Gold, S2 Bronze, S3 Gold)

3\. Bends and Hitches Champion

4\. Dragonboat Champion

The cadets trained hard under the guidance of their teachers-in-charge and instructor. The unit's success is a testimony to the enduring value of our school motto, Nil Sine Labore.

Well done, Victorians! Whatever you can achieve in CCA with hard work, you can do likewise in other aspects of life. Continue to aim high, work hard and excel.

Nil Sine Labore.
