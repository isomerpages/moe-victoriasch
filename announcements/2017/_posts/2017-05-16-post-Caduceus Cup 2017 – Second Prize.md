# **Caduceus Cup 2017 – Second Prize**
Six Victorians took part in Caduceus Cup 2017 today. This is a public speaking competition for secondary school students in Singapore, co-organised by Hwa Chong Institution and the NUS Centre for Biomedical Ethics.

This year's competition is centred around the theme of biomedical ethics. We are proud to announce that Nirupan from 4F clinched the second prize for this competition. Congratulations!

Nil Sine Labore.
