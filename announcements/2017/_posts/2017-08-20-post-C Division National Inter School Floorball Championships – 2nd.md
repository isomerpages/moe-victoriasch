We are National 2nd for C Division Floorball!

We played against Catholic High School in the National Finals today! It was an intense game of high quality, with both teams putting on display good skills, movement and team work. Despite our best efforts, we lost 2-3 and emerged as National 2nd. Congratulations to the team!

We thank our teachers-in-charge, coach, parents and alumni for the strong support. Special thanks to the student leaders and supporters who cheered their hearts out.

With this match, the sporting season comes to a close for 2017. We will train hard, and emerge stronger for next season!

Nil Sine Labore.
