Team Victoria came up against a formidable opponent in Meridian Secondary School. Despite trailing 0-4 and 2-6 in the match, the team displayed resolve, determination and grit to stay close. Eventually, the team erased the 4-goal deficit to tie the game at 6-6 with less than 1 minute to end of the third period. After a strategic timeout called by team captain Darius Phua, a well-executed sequence of precise passes by VSÂ ensued and brought the game to a climax when Mexximus Ow scored the crucial goal in the final seconds to win the game and the Championship, 7-6!

An epic match.

The season was never easy as the team played many close games, won by the slightest of margins and often had to rally from behind. However, these moments strengthened the team's resilience and sharpened the players' craft. Today, these qualities were on display throughout the match.

The success would not be possible without the guidance of our teachers-in-charge, teachers, coach, seniors , parents and the overwhelming support shown by the contingent of supporting Victorians at both the semi-final and final matches. A big thank you to everyone for your belief and confidence in the team!

We look forward to our B Division boys inspiring their juniors to the success in the C Division tournament in July.

Once again, congratulations and well done to our B Division Floorball team! Victorians, we are proud of you!

Nil Sine Labore.
