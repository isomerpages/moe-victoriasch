# **B and C Division National Wushu Championships – 3rd and 2nd**

![](/images/Wushu-14.jpg)

After seven days of competition (involving many individual and team events), our Wushu teams achieved National 2nd for C Division and National 3rd for B Division.

It has been a joy watching our wushu athletes perfecting their routines during training, doing their best during the competition, and encouraging one another throughout the season. We are glad to see them experience, develop, grow and excel during the National School Games wushu season.

Congratulations, Victorians! You have worked hard and become better individuals and as a team. Continue to help one another grow in values, skills and knowledge. Come back even stronger next season!

We would like to thank our teachers-in-charge, alumni and parents who supported the wushu teams throughout the season. The teams' success is impossible without you. Thank you for guiding our Victorians in their learning journey.

We would also like to congratulate the wushu seniors in VJC who achieved National Champion for A Division Boys and National 3rd for A Division Girls. Together, we keep the Victorian flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore.
