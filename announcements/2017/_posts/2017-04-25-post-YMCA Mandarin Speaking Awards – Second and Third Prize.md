YMCA Mandarin Speaking Awards - After an intense competition involving the delivery of a prepared speech in Mandarin and two impromptu speeches in Mandarin and English respectively, we are proud to announce that Victorians Zhao Shibo from 3A and Tay Darren from 4I clinched second and third prize in the upper secondary category respectively.

The competition provided an opportunity for VS boys to showcase their confidence and flair in delivering speeches in both Mandarin and English.

It is worth mentioning that Victorians occupied half of the Semi Final slots and took 4 out of 7 places in the finals that took place today.

Well done boys!
