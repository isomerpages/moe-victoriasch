Distinction!

We are pleased to announce that the VS Concert Band has been awarded the Certificate of Distinction in the Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2017.

Through the preparation process, the band learnt the importance of consistency, discipline and teamwork. The hard work paid off and the band provided a wonderful rendition of the set piece 'March Sunny Island' by Wong Kah Chun and Hymn to the Sun with the beat of Mother Earth by Satoshi Yagisawa. The band played as one band, with one sound, soul and spirit.

We would like to thank all teachers-in-charge, teachers, conductor, sectional tutors, alumni and parents who gave their fullest support to every band member. The band's success is impossible without you.

All the best to our VS Choir, Chinese Orchestra and English Drama for your upcoming SYF Arts Presentation! Press on. You can do it as one team. Together, we keep VS' flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore.
