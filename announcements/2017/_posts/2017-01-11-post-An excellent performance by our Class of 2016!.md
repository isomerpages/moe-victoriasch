Victoria Celebrates! An excellent performance by our Class of 2016!

Our class of 2016 Victorians gathered again in our familiar school hall to celebrate their achievements.

2016 was an amazing year as we celebrated our school's 140th Anniversary (VS140). Throughout 2016, we had an exciting line-up of activities which we witnessed a showcase of Victorian talents and forged countless wonderful memories.

The success of the VS140 events was through the collective effort of the staff, students, alumni, parents and partners. Our Class of 2016, as the most senior Victorians, played a key role in leading the student leadership boards, CCAs and classes to plan, implement and help out during our VS140 events.

Academically, the Class of 2016 turned in an outstanding performance in the 2016 GCE O Level and Year 4 Examinations.

As a school, we are very proud of the collective achievements attained by our Class of 2016. Our Victorians have worked hard and excelled, balancing academic, co-curricular demands and leadership responsibilities. Our Class of 2016 Victorians have been good role-models, showed their juniors what it means to be a Victorian, and inspired their juniors in their Victorian journey.

As our Class of 2016 continues on their educational journey, we wish every Victorian all the best in their future endeavours. Once a Victorian, Always a Victorian. Keep our school flag unfurled.

Viva Victoria! Nil Sine Labore!
