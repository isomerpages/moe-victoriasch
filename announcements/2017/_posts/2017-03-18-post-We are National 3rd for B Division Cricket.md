It has been an intense season for Team VS, with many close matches between us and our opponents. Despite the competition, our team persevered and grew in character, skills and knowledge. Today, our team showed their resolve and won the match against St Andrew's Secondary School.

Congratulations and well done, Victorians! We are proud of you. Continue to excel and inspire your juniors.

We would like to thank our teachers-in-charge, teachers, coaches, parents and alumni who guided and supported our Cricket team. In addition, a big thank you to the supporters who encouraged the team during the matches. Together, we keep VS' flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore.
