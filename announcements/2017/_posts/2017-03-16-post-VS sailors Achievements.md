After four days of intense competition, our VS sailors achieved the C Division National 2nd (Byte), C Division National 3rd (Optimist) and B Division National 2nd.

In spite of the challenging weather conditions these few days, our sailors persevered, focused and continued with the race. Throughout the competition, our sailors supported one another, with juniors and seniors encouraging one another. Their grit, determination and teamwork enabled them to complete the race successfully.

Congratulations and well done, Victorians! We are proud of you. Continue to grow in skills, strength and stature. Keep our VS' flag unfurled!

We would also like to congratulate our sailing seniors in VJC who achieved A Division National 3rd (Boys). Great job and continue to inspire your juniors!

Nil Sine Labore.
