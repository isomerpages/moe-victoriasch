Double Gold!

We are proud to share that our NCC (Land) and NCC (Sea) units have both achieved the Gold Award for the Best Unit Competition for Assessment Year 2016.

Congratulations to our NCC (Land) and NCC (Sea) Units! Well done! We are proud of you. Your hard work have led to the excellent results.

We would like to thank our teachers-in-charge, alumni, voluntary adult leaders, parents and partners for the support. Your support is important to the unit's success.

To our cadets, continue to aim high, work hard and work together as a team. Teamwork is essential to sustained success. Together, Everyone Achieves More. As a team, uphold the unit's culture, heritage and tradition of excellence. Keep our school flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore.
