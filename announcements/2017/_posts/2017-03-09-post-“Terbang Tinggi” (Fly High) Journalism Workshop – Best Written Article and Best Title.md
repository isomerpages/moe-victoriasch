# **“Terbang Tinggi” (Fly High) Journalism Workshop – Best Written Article and Best Title**

![](/images/Workshop-1.jpg)
On the 17 March 2017, Muhammad Irfan Bin Rozaimi (2B), Raiyyan Hakim Abdurrahman (1C) and Mohamed Farhat (1C) participated in "Terbang Tinggi" (Fly High), a journalism workshop organised by the local Malay paper Berita Harian.

During the workshop, students were to interview people and write articles about them. Coincidentally, the boys interviewed Captain Abdul Aziz Buang, an old boy of Victoria School who piloted Malaysia–Singapore Airlines, Singapore Airlines and Scoot flights. He spent memorable time at the Tyrwhitt Road campus.

The boys went on to clinch the ”best written article” and “best title” of the workshop.

Good job, boys!
