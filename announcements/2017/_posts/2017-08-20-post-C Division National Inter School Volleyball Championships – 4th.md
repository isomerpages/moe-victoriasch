We are National 4th for C Division Volleyball!

Congratulations to the team! As the National School Games season ends, do reflect on your experience, learn from the the experience, focus on your goals, improve on your weaknesses, and come back stronger next year. Continue to work hard, excel and keep VS' flag unfurled.

We thank our teachers-in-charge, coach, parents and alumni for the strong support. Special thanks to the student leaders who came down today and cheered their hearts out.

Nil Sine Labore.
