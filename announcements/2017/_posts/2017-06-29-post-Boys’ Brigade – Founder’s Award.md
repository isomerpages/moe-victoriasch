At the award presentation ceremony held this evening at SAFRA Jurong, we are proud to share that Gabriel Yong Ming Hui (4D), Shane Ng Rong (4F) and Tay Siang Jet (4G) were presented with the Founder's Award by Mr Desmond Lee, Minister, Prime Minister's Office, Second Minister Ministry of Home Affairs & Ministry of National Development.

Congratulations, Victorians! We are proud of what you have achieved through commitment, diligence and determination. Continue to work hard and you will excel.
