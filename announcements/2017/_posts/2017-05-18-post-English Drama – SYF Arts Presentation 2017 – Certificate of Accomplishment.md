It is an Accomplishment for drama!

We are proud to announce that VS's entry in the SYF Arts Presentation titled 'Shadows' has been awarded the Certificate of Accomplishment.

We have seen the boys work hard amidst their other commitments and challenging themselves to put up a better performance every practice.

Under the guidance of teachers and instructors, the boys have created a performance that will remind themselves the passion and hard work they have committed.

We look forward to more exciting performances by the boys!

Good job, Victorians!
