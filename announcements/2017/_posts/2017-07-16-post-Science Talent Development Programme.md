# **Science Talent Development Programme**

Last week, as part of the school's Science Talent Development Programme, our Victorians took part in a series of Science-related competitions:

1) Two teams of Victorians participated in the East Zone A\*STAR Science Fair, organised by Victoria Junior College. Our team, comprising of Anthony Tamzil, Lim Yee Kian and Chong Yan Kang, achieved our first gold award for their autonomous algal filtration device.

2) At the Forensic Science Challenge organised by Victoria Junior College, our team clinched the Second place, though we were the only Lower Secondary team that participated.

3) At the EUREKA competition organized by Raffles Institution, Ryan Ng, Donovan Loh and Kieron Lee obtained Honourable Mention.

Congratulations, Victorians! Keep up the good work!

Nil Sine Labore.
