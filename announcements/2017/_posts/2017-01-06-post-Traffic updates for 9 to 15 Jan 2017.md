# **\*Traffic updates for 9-15 Jan 2017**

For Victorians who take the bus to school, they should enter the school via Side Gate A. At the end of the day, students who take the bus should exit by Side Gate A.

In dry weather, parents who drive their sons to school should drop their sons along Siglap Link outside Gate 1. These Victorians should then enter the campus via the pedestrian walkway alongside the Gate 1. (Note: The pedestrian walkway alongside Main Gate will be closed fromÂ 9 Jan 2017).

In wet weather (when it is raining), parents who drive their sons to school should drop their sons along Siglap Link outside Gate 1. Victorians should then enter the campus via pedestrian walkway alongside Gate 1.

For parents who drive, do drive slowly and follow the directions from our traffic marshalls. Our sons study here.
