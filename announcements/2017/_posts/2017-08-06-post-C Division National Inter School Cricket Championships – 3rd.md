Our C Div cricket team clinched National 3rd today by beating St Andrews' Secondary School in the 3rd / 4th placing match. Congratulations and well done boys!

With this victory, both B and C div teams finished the season 3rd.

We would like to thank the coaches, teachers in charge, parents and alumni for your support, guidance and motivation in making the season a success.

The boys will definitely train hard and come back stronger in 2018!

Nil Sine Labore.
