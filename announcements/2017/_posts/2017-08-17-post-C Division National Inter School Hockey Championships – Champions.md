We won! We are the National Champions for C Division Hockey!

It was a closely-fought match in rainy weather against a worthy opponent. Despite the challenging weather and pitch conditions, our team showed determination, focus, grit, resilience and teamwork. With the hunger to win and the collective effort to excel, our team achieved victory with a score of 1-0.

We would like to thank all supporters who came yesterday and today to witness our victory. A big shout-out to the student leaders who cheered with gusto in the rain for the team.

We would also like to thank our school leaders, coaches, parents, teachers-in charge and seniors who patiently guided and motivated us to our victory.

Nil Sine Labore.
