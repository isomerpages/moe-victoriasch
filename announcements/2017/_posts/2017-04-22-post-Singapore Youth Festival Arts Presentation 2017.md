SYF Arts Presentation - Two more Distinctions for Victoria School!

We are pleased to announce that the Victoria School Chinese Orchestra and Choir have both clinched Certification of Distinction in the recently concluded Singapore Youth Festival Arts Presentation 2017 to join the ranks of the Concert Band. This is the second time a clean sweep is achieved by the 3 musical groups.

Congratulations, Victorians! We are proud of you. You have grown and matured individually. We have also seen Choir and Chinese Orchestra honing their musicality, strengths and teamwork. Continue to believe in yourself, work hard and improve. Keep VS' flag unfurled!

We would like to thank all teachers-in-charge, teachers, conductor, sectional instructors, alumni and parents who gave their fullest support to every member.

All the best to English Drama for your upcoming SYF Arts Presentation on Monday, 24 April!
