Our B and C Division Table Tennis teams played their respective National 3rd / 4th placing matches today.

First up, the C Division faced Maris Stella High School. It was an intriguing match that went to the wire. Despite our best efforts, we lost to our opponents 2-3 and clinched the National 4th position.

Next up, our B division boys went up against Catholic High School. Both teams were evenly matched, and the match was highlighted by scintillating shot-making by players from both teams. Eventually, our boys held their composure and emerged victorious, clinching the National 3rd position.

We would like to thank our coach, teachers and parents for your guidance and support! It has been a rewarding season and we are confident to return next year, stronger.

Nil Sine Labore.
