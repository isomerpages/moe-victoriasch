# **Victoria School 144th Anniversary & Speech Day**

Congratulations to all prize winners! Speech Day is a milestone event for us to celebrate the achievements of our Victorians. Throughout the years, we have also taken this opportunity to recognize and show appreciation to our VS educators and staff for their contribution to the Education Service and to our Victorians’ development and growth. It is with a heavy heart that we had to make the difficult decision to cancel our 144th Speech Day, which was originally scheduled to take place on 11 July 2020.

 If you have any wishes for the prize winners and to our staff, please complete the [**Google form**](https://form.gov.sg/5e93e7f38751b300114ea21e). We will share your wishes with the winners and staff.

In 2021, we will be celebrating our 145th anniversary and we hope to welcome you back to Victoria and join in our celebrations.

Nil Sine Labore.
