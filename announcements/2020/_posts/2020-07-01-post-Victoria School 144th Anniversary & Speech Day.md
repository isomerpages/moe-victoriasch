# **Victoria School 144th Anniversary & Speech Day**

Dear Class of 2019,

 We have been closely monitoring the evolving Covid-19 situation. We have put in place the necessary precautions to ensure the well-being of our students and staff, and will continue to align these measures with the national posture. This is why in line with the Government’s heightened safe distancing measures, we have now made the difficult decision to cancel our 144th Speech Day, which was originally scheduled to take place on 11 July 2020.

Speech Day is a milestone event for us to recognise and celebrate your achievements. It is with a heavy heart that we had to make a decision that will understandably disappoint you and your family. We will be making arrangements for you to collect your prizes and certificates. We will inform you of the details when it is ready.

We wish you best of health. Stay Safe, Stay Strong, Stay United.

Nil Sine Labore.
