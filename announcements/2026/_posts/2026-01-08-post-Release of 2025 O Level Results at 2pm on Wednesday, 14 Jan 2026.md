<p>Dear Victorians of Class 2025,</p>
<p></p>
<p>The results of the 2025 Singapore-Cambridge General Certificate of Education
Ordinary Level (GCE O-Level) examination will be released at 2pm on Wednesday,
14 January 2026.</p>
<p></p>
<p>You are required to be in proper school attire (i.e. <strong>full school uniform</strong> with
approved shoes) and be seated in the School Hall by <strong>1.30 pm</strong> for
an important Joint Admissions Exercise (JAE) briefing before the release
of your results at 2 pm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students are expected to demonstrate appropriate bearing when returning
to the school to collect their results. Those not dressed in accordance
with our attire and grooming standards (e.g.&nbsp; no outlandish hair style,
permed hair or dyed hair) will not be allowed to enter the school hall
for the release of results. Where necessary, you may be asked to return
home to rectify these matters before coming back to school.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Please settle all outstanding school fees with the General Office and
return all items borrowed from the school (e.g School Blazer) before 1.30
pm on Wednesday.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Students who are unable to collect their results in person should inform
the school and can appoint a proxy to collect a physical copy of their
results on their behalf. Proxies are required to produce the relevant documents
for the school’s verification when collecting the results. You may contact
the school for assistance if you are unable to appoint a proxy, or if you
have not received your system-generated username for SEAB’s Candidates
Portal.</p>
<p></p>
