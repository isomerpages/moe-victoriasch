    <label for="accordion2">Key Student Outcomes</label>
    <div>
			<p>VS Floorball follows 5 key principles. Firstly, we aim to develop leadership, a robust team spirit and a positive winning <b>attitude</b> through exposure in the external Singapore Floorball Leagues, National Inter-School Tournaments, friendly matches and team camps. We assist our students in perfecting their <b>basic</b> skills and knowledge of the sport and we focus on having clear and respectful <b>communication</b> between student to student, student to coach and student to teachers. In addition, we develop <b>discipline</b> individually, as a line and as a team and we expect students to be focused and <b>enthusiastic</b> regardless during trainings, matches, camps and academic lessons.</p>
