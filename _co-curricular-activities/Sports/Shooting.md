    <div>
      <p>Victoria School Shooting Club was established in 1992 with only 6 members and grew to about 25 members today. Previously known as Air Rifle Club, VS Shooting Club was training with only air rifles until 2009. Trainings were conducted in shooting range outside of Victoria School. The dream of having our very own shooting range was finally realised when we moved to our new campus at Siglap Link in 2003.</p>
