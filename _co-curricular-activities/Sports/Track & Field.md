    <div>
      <p>Track & Field in Victoria School was formed in 1939. As there was not many inter-school competitions at that time, the athletes often competed against organisations like the British Army. VS Track & Field relay team won the Sir Arthur Young Cup six times between 1939 and 1955. In the 1960’s, the VS Track & Field teams were always in the top 2 positions in the Serangoon District Championships. From 1990’s to the present, the B and C Division teams were consistently in the Top 4 positions, with the C Division team being National Champions in 1981, 1992 and 2000.</p>
