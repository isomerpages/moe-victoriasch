      <p>Sailing in VS was established in 2002 and started with a small group of students.</p>
			<p>Throughout the year, training takes place twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays.  In the month leading up to the competitions, we conduct intensive training thrice a week. With great support from the National Sailing Centre and the close knitted sailing family, we are able to grow in numbers and currently have a total of 24 sailors</p>
