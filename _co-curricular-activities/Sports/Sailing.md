    <div>
      <p>Sailing in VS was established in 2002 and started with a small group of students.</p>
			<p>Throughout the year, training takes place twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays.  In the month leading up to the competitions, we conduct intensive training thrice a week. With great support from the National Sailing Centre and the close knitted sailing family, we are able to grow in numbers and currently have a total of 24 sailors</p>

    <div>
			<p>The CCA will enable our students to develop in terms of character, including discipline, perseverance and resilience because of the long hours of training and commitment they would need to have. They will also learn to appreciate the value of performance excellence where they striving to do their best in all their endeavours</p>
			<p>In terms of skills, they develop their sailing and decision-making abilities when they are out at sea during competitions. This helps them to improve as sailors.</p>
			<p>In addition, attending training sessions diligently also helps to foster social integration and deepens studentsâ€™ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to school, community and nation.</p>
