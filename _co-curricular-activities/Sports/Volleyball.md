      <p>Volleyball has a long history in Victoria School around 1965. The team was previously disbanded for a number of years and then revived when an old boy and ex-volleyball player (Mr Liong Huai Yu), joined the school as an Art teacher in 2003. The coach Mr Yap Ah Kuan was roped in and since then, the team has gone on to achieve many Zonal Top 4 position in B and C Divisions Competitions.<br><br>The team also managed to achieve National Top 4 position 3 times in the past 12 years.</p>
