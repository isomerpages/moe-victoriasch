      <p>Victoria School Red Cross Unit was formed in 27th March 1976 and started as a small group of students. With great support from the Singapore Red Cross Headquarter and the Singapore Red Cross Youths, we have continued to grow in great numbers and are a strong unit of about 70 students today.</p>

    <div>
			<p>Victoria School Red Cross Unit (VSRCCU) is a CCA that integrates character-building, leadership, essential lifesaving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.</p>
			<p>We aim to bring out the best in our Cadets and to prepare them for leadership with a heart. At the community level, VSRCCU participates regularly with the Red Cross Youth Club which provides a sustainable platform for our cadets to serve the vulnerable in our communities.  This includes volunteering at various blood donation drives and other community-service projects.</p>
			<p>VSRCCU strives to instil the Red Cross Youth spirit and strengthen core values such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all members. By participating in providing Singapore Red Cross humanitarian services, the cadets are groomed to become good citizens with a strong sense of civic responsibility. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.</p>
