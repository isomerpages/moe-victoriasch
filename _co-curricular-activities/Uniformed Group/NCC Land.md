    <div>
      <p>Victoria Bridge School was one of the first six schools in Singapore to form a National Cadet Corps (NCC) unit in 1918. The Victoria School NCC Unit was first inaugurated at the beginning of 1969, with 61 Land cadets and 51 Air cadets. Victoria School NCC Unit has taken part in many events, most notably, the National Day Parade in 1969 where 43 third year cadets were selected to represent the city district for the parade. On 19th June 1970, 34 Secondary four and pre-university cadets were selected to mount the guard-of-honour at the opening ceremony of the Extra-Curricular Activities centre by Minister of Education.</p>
			<p>In 1974, VS NCC Land unit took part in Haddon Cup Drill Competition, and emerged winners in the Serangoon district. Six cadets and one officer also joined the rest of the school for a tour of lake Toba, and climbed Mt. Sebayak in record time according to the guide.</p>
			<p>In 1976 and 1977, the VS NCC Land unit was selected to represent the Serangoon district in the final of the National Drill Competition, and emerged as one of the top three at a district level. In 1978, the VS NCC Land unit also made a big jump in the Best Unit Competition, from 39th to 12th, and in 1979, from 12th to 4th. In 1980, VS NCC Land unit emerged as champions in the .22 T/bolt shooting competition for the first time, and jumped from 4th to 3rd position in the Best Unit Competition.</p>
			<p>From 2005 to 2014, VS NCC Land unit has been achieving Gold award for the annual Best Unit Competition.  The Victoria School NCC Land Unit has come very far since its humble beginnings in Victoria Bridge School.</p>
