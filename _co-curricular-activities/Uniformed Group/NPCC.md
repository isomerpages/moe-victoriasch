    <div>
      <p>Established in 1959, National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) had endured many challenges and grown and matured with the nation. NPCC was first formed in 1959 with just 1 secondary school with 30 students, and has since expanded to 152 secondary schools with 16000 members in 2015, making us one of the popular uniformed youth organisations in Singapore.</p>
			<p>Victoria School NPCC Unit has established ourselves to be one of the stronger units in Singapore, achieving our 16th consecutive Gold Award in the Unit Overall Proficiency Award for our hard work in 2015. The unit has also worked hard over the years to achieve top awards at the various National Competitions. With a total of 103 cadets, 6 Cadet Inspectors, 1 Honorary Officer and 4 Teacher Officers in 2016, Victoria School NPCC Unit is one of the biggest CCAs and Uniformed Groups in Victoria School.</p>

			<p>Victoria School Red Cross Unit (VSRCCU) is a CCA that integrates character-building, leadership, essential lifesaving skills and blood donation knowledge, local community service and overseas humanitarian projects in its curriculum, with the Red Cross ethos and service to humanity as a core focus.</p>
			<p>We aim to bring out the best in our Cadets and to prepare them for leadership with a heart. At the community level, VSRCCU participates regularly with the Red Cross Youth Club which provides a sustainable platform for our cadets to serve the vulnerable in our communities.  This includes volunteering at various blood donation drives and other community-service projects.</p>
			<p>VSRCCU strives to instil the Red Cross Youth spirit and strengthen core values such as compassion, passion and professionalism in all members. By participating in providing Singapore Red Cross humanitarian services, the cadets are groomed to become good citizens with a strong sense of civic responsibility. They are trained to be adaptable, resilient and confident team players.</p>
