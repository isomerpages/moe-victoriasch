      <p>Established in 1959, National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) had endured many challenges and grown and matured with the nation. NPCC was first formed in 1959 with just 1 secondary school with 30 students, and has since expanded to 152 secondary schools with 16000 members in 2015, making us one of the popular uniformed youth organisations in Singapore.</p>
			<p>Victoria School NPCC Unit has established ourselves to be one of the stronger units in Singapore, achieving our 16th consecutive Gold Award in the Unit Overall Proficiency Award for our hard work in 2015. The unit has also worked hard over the years to achieve top awards at the various National Competitions. With a total of 103 cadets, 6 Cadet Inspectors, 1 Honorary Officer and 4 Teacher Officers in 2016, Victoria School NPCC Unit is one of the biggest CCAs and Uniformed Groups in Victoria School.</p>

			<p>The mission of the National Police Cadet Corps is to develop our members to be active citizens and community leaders, by working in partnership with Singapore Police Force (SPF) to fight crime and keep Singapore safe.</p>
			<p>The vision of the National Police Cadet Corps is to become the best youth organisation in Singapore, one that actively helps to make Singapore the safest place in the world.</p>
			<p>In accordance with our mission and observing our objectives, we believe in:</p>
			<p> • Developing Leaders with Characters and Values<br>Ensure our growth by exposing us to a challenging environment, which, in turn will imbibe us with leadership qualities, strong character and civic, social and moral values.</p>
		 <p> • Build Bonds with SPF<br>Enlighten us on the role of the Singapore Police Force, help to build a stronger bond of friendship with them, and so lead to a safer place for all in the country.</p>
			<p> • Showing Care &amp; Concern to Others<br>As part of a culture that encourages us to treat fellow cadets with respect, courtesy and tact, teach us to extend the same care and concern to others.</p>
			<p> • Facing Challenges &amp; Achieving Excellence<br>As a result of our identification with the Singapore Police Force, teach us to adopt its tradition of high standards of performance, commitment, duty and service, to seek to excel and to face up to challenge.</p>
			<p>Through the various training programmes at Victoria School NPCC Unit, we also aim to develop every Victorian into a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman who makes tangible contributions to his family, work, community and nation, as well as to groom upright and balanced individuals with leadership qualities and the core values of Performance Excellence, Respect, Integrity, Discipline and Empathy.</p>
