    <div>
      <p>The Arrow Scout Group in Victoria School formerly known as the Sixth Troop was established in 1922 at the old Victoria Bridge School. It was the sixth school based scout troop to be formed in Singapore.<br>As a youth movement, we are NOT regimented. But we inculcate discipline, leadership qualities and teamwork attributes through informal education processes at various formative stages of our young members.<br>Scouting encourages the holistic physical, mental, spiritual and social development of youth with a strong emphasis on duty to God, duty to country, and helping other people.</p>
