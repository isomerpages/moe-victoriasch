    <div>
      <p>Victoria School Brass Band was formed in 1965 with 26 instruments and 30 members from the Pre-U levels, where it first performed at the National Day Parade in 1967. It was renamed Victoria School Military Band in 1971 before acquiring its current name, Victoria School Concert Band, in 1983.</p>
			<p>In 1974, the band presented its first concert in the ‘Musical World’ series, at the old Victoria School hall at Thyrwhitt Road. Since then, these concerts are put up to showcase their talents. In 2016, we will be performing Musical World XXVI.</p>
