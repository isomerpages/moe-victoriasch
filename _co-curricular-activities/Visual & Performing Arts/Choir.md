    <div>
      <p>Victoria School Choir was established on the 14 of August in 1991 under the direction of Professor Nelson Kwei, a pre-eminent local choral conductor. The choir began with only about 40 members, with their first ever performance during the school’s Prefects’ Investiture in 1992. The choir has done well and the decision was made then that the choir would perform in public in Victoria Concert Hall on 26 of August 1992, which was the birth of the biennial Rhapsody concert series.</p>
