    <div>
      <p>VS Photography Club was formed in 2013. Previously known as the Photography and Journalism Club, it has become a strong presence in covering school events. Since 2015, the club has branched into photography competitions, photography exhibitions and projects related to photography.  Although VS Photography Club operates in a small scale, it plays a crucial role in supporting school events by providing photography coverage which helps to document significant occasions and milestones of the school. VS Photography Club is a specialised club which provides members with professional photography training, pre and post photography production and exposure to various photography equipment.</p>
