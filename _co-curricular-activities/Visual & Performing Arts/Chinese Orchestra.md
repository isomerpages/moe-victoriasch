    <div>
      <p>Victoria School Chinese Orchestra (VSCO), established in 1974, saw its humble beginnings as a CCA with merely 20 enrolled members who were self-taught. However, this was only temporary as the orchestra witnessed an increase in population in the 1980s and 1990s, allowing us to engage in festive events such as Mid-Autumn and Chinese New Year concerts and Speech Day performances.</p>
			<p>Through the rich experiences accumulated, we clinched the Gold Award in the biennial Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) in 1997, and 5 consecutive Gold Awards from 2003 to 2011. In 2013 and 2015, we achieved the Certificate of Distinction in SYF.</p>
			<p>Today, VSCO is a far cry from its pioneer batch. We have about 70 dedicated members in the CCA. In addition, our alumni also frequently return to assist in various events.</p>
			<p>Through the guidance of our instructors and conductor from the Singapore Chinese Orchestra, VSCO hopes to sustain the flame of its progress and leave behind a legacy as we continue to nurture the performing arts culture in Victoria School.</p>
