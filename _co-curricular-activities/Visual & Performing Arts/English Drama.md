    <div>
      <p>The English Drama Society sees not only the growth of actors but also of writers, specifically that of scriptwriters amidst them. The Victoria School English Drama Society saw its initial form in the shape of the Literary and Debating Society as early as the 1940s, and later became known as the English Literary, Drama and Debate Society (ELDDS). In 2015, the ELDDS split into two different clubs to distinguish two distinct pools of talentâ€”the ardent actors and the well-versed speakers of the school.</p>
