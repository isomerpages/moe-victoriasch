      <p>Victoria School Audio-Visual (AV) Club aims to provide the best audio and visual support for all school events that are held within the school. Our AV boys are skilled in providing basic sound mixing and lightings, as well as managing complex equipment setup, such as the portable sound systems, screens and various types of microphones for different situation eg. Lunch-Time Concerts and school carnivals. On top of providing excellence service, they learn professional work ethics, which include discipline, alertness and ever-readiness. Combining with the necessary skills acquired, our boys become expert media-handling crew members during dynamic events. As a CCA, we provide support in every way possible to ensure our participants and audiences will have sound-pleasing, visually-stimulating, mesmerizing and memorable experiences.</p>
			<p>All it takes to join this CCA is an interest in managing sound and visual equipment, the willingness to learn and to be a team player.</p>
