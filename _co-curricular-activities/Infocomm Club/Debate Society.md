    <div>
      <p>The Debate Society in Victoria School was formed only in 2014 with a present membership of 19 students from Secondary/Year One to Secondary/Year 4.  It used to be part of the English Language Drama and Debate Club Society. Since the skills for drama and debate differ, it was then decided that both should function independently.</p>
