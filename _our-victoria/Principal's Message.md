<p>As I reflect on the year ahead, I do so with a deep sense of purpose and
confidence in what Victoria School can continue to become. For almost 150
years, our school has shaped young men of character, and today we remain
committed to building on that legacy while preparing our students for a
rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>Over the past year, we refreshed our school direction to honour our heritage
while giving clearer shape to the kind of Victorian we hope to nurture.
For many years, the mission of nurturing a Gentleman, Professional and
Sportsman guided generations of students and continues to hold meaning
for many. Building on this foundation, we recognised that the world our
boys will inherit requires more than personal accomplishment. It calls
for young men who are anchored in values, confident in their identity and
committed to their community and country.</p>
<p>This commitment is captured in our refreshed direction. Victoria School
now aspires for every student to grow into a Gentleman · Sportsman · Leader,
guided by a mission to lead and serve with purpose. Our values of Service,
Tenacity, Responsibility, Integrity, Vision and Empathy (STRIVE) shape
the culture we cultivate each day. These values broaden our understanding
of excellence. We believe excellence is most meaningful when paired with
humility, integrity and care for others. At its heart, this is a move from
Me to We, reflecting our belief that leadership begins with character and
finds its purpose in service.</p>
<p>This direction also reinforces our partnership with Cedar Girls’ Secondary
School and Victoria Junior College. The review of the Integrated Programme
that concluded in 2024 provided an opportunity to reaffirm our shared commitment
to developing high-ability learners who think deeply, act ethically and
contribute purposefully. Victoria School will continue to align our programmes
with this approach, including for students on the SEC track, so that learning
remains rigorous, meaningful and forward-looking.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we want our boys to grow in confidence, curiosity and
composure. We aim to nurture young men who are globally aware and cross-culturally
literate, able to collaborate with others and ready to navigate an interconnected
world. We have begun exploring sustainable partnerships with overseas schools
to create opportunities for Victorians not only to learn about the world
but also to build friendships and broaden their perspectives through authentic
experiences.</p>
<p>At the heart of our work is the growth of every student. Whether in the
classroom, on the sports field, in the performing arts or serving the community,
we seek to nurture resilience, teamwork and a desire to do what is right.
These qualities endure and shape the adults our boys will become.</p>
<p>The work of Victoria School is made possible by a dedicated team of teachers,
allied educators, staff in the School Administration Team and Victoria
Hall. Their professionalism and commitment ensure that our boys learn in
an environment that is caring, supportive and purposeful. We are also grateful
to our coaches and instructors who partner us in developing our students
through CCAs, contributing to their growth in meaningful ways.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to be supported by the Victoria Advisory Committee, the
Old Victorians’ Association and the Parents Support Group. Their guidance,
partnership and generosity have strengthened our programmes and enriched
the school experience for our boys. Their continued belief in the mission
of Victoria School reflects the strong sense of belonging that connects
generations of Victorians.</p>
<p>As we approach Victoria School’s 150<sup>th</sup> Anniversary in 2026,
we stand at a significant moment in our history. Our theme, Honour Our
Heritage, Inspire the Future, invites us to celebrate the legacy we have
inherited while looking ahead with ambition and purpose. We welcome all
Victorians, past and present, to journey with us as we prepare for this
milestone and envision the next chapter of our growth.</p>
<p>Victoria School remains committed to nurturing young gentlemen, sportsmen
and leaders who learn with purpose, serve with conviction and lead with
integrity. I look forward to the possibilities ahead and to all that our
boys will achieve in the years to come.</p>
