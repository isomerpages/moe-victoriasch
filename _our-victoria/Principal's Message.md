As I reflect on my first year in Victoria School, I do so with deep gratitude and optimism. It has been an honour to step into the role of Principal of Victoria School, an institution that has stood proudly since its founding in 1876. I thank my predecessor, Mr Chow Weisi, and the principals before him, for their dedication and vision in building the strong foundation upon which Victoria School thrives as a beacon of excellence.

From its beginnings as an English class for twelve Malay boys at Kampong Glam Malay Branch School, Victoria School has grown into an autonomous all-boys school offering the Integrated Programme and the GCE O-Level Programme. This evolution reflects not only our remarkable journey but also our commitment to providing quality education that meets the diverse needs of our students.

One of the most heartening aspects of my first year has been meeting members of the Victorian family. Our alumni shared fond memories of their time here and reminding me of the strong bonds formed within these walls. Their stories highlight the rich heritage of Victoria School. I am inspired by the contributions many of them have made as leaders in politics, the public sector, the community, and business. Their achievements are a testament to the transformative power of education and the shared responsibility of nurturing future generations.

The vibrant smiles and laughter of our students as they engage in their many activities and adventures, both within and beyond the school, have left an indelible impression on me. Their enthusiasm and energy embody the spirit of the next generation of leaders. I am also deeply appreciative of the steadfast support of the Victoria School Parents Support Group, which has played a vital role in enriching the school experience for our boys.

Victoria School’s heritage is further enhanced by its strong partnerships, particularly through the Victoria-Cedar Alliance with Victoria Junior College and Cedar Girls' Secondary School. These collaborations amplify our mission to nurture well-rounded individuals of character and capability who can contribute meaningfully to society.

As I look ahead, I reflect on Victoria School’s role in building Singapore’s future. How can we nurture young gentlemen who are not only academically excellent but also socially responsible and morally grounded? How can we inspire every student to develop a deep sense of purpose and commitment to the greater good?

Our school motto, _Nil Sine Labore_, serves as a steadfast guide, reminding us of the dedication and resilience required to achieve success. Alongside our vision of developing every Victorian into a Gentleman, Sportsman, and Leader, we aim to cultivate young men who will make tangible contributions to their families, communities, and the nation.

This year has also been a time of introspection on how we can further enhance the holistic development of our students. Academic excellence, character building, sportsmanship, and leadership remain at the core of a Victoria education. Beyond these, I hope our students will forge lifelong friendships, embrace the joy of learning, and discover ways to contribute meaningfully to society.

As we approach another year, let us hold fast to the values and traditions that define us while embracing innovation and growth. Together with my staff, I am confident we can lead Victoria School into its next phase of distinction, always striving for greater heights.

As we celebrate the successes of another year at Victoria School, let us cherish each moment as an opportunity for growth—both individually and collectively. Together, we will uphold our proud traditions while embracing the challenges and opportunities ahead.

Here’s to many more years of excellence at Victoria School!
