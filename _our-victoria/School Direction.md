# **School Direction - Vision, Mission and Values**

![](/images/vmv_2017.jpg)

### School Vision

Every Victorian is a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman who makes tangible contributions to his family, work, community and nation.

### School Mission

To groom upright and balanced individuals with leadership qualities.

### Core Values

*   **P** – Performance Excellence
*   **R** – Respect
*   **I** – Integrity
*   **D** – Discipline
*   **E** – Empathy

The five values of **P**erformance Excellence, **R**espect, **I**ntegrity, **D**iscipline and **E**mpathy (affectionately known as the PRIDE values) reflect what staff and students feel are important to them. We also hope that students have PRIDE in the school and our distinctive heritage, and carry themselves with PRIDE as a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman (GPS).

### Motto

Nil Sine Labore (Nothing Without Labour)
