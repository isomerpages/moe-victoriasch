*   Recognising and rewarding performance and achievement at all levels.

*   Enhancing quality of programmes by developing partnership with corporations and tertiary institutions, which will ensure the relevance of the programmes offered.

*   Developing programmes that instil the Victoria Spirit in its members and continue the rich tradition of the school.

*   Promoting a globally orientated environment.

*   Promoting an innovative atmosphere that strives for continuous improvement.

*   Contributing actively to the community.
