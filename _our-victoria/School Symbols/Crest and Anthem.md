The open book symbolizes lifelong learning.

The torch symbolizes truth and the passing on of a tradition. It also illuminates the way of Victorians who venture forth to excel beyond the shores of Singapore.

### Victoria Anthem

_Lyrics by J A Frazer  
Music by W E Meyer_

Victoria In Singapore,  
There are other schools we know,  
Victoria is something more,  
The school that watch’d us grow.

For here we’ve learnt and striven too.  
And played the sportsman’s game;  
Victoria, we give to you  
The honour that you claim.

Victoria thy sons are we,  
And we will not forget,  
Victoria thy triumphs see,  
And victories we share yet.

For others came before and went,  
And carried to the world,  
Victoria’s fame and our intent  
To keep her flag unfurled.
