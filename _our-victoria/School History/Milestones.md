# **Milestones**

Victoria School grew, just like her students. She grew from Singapore’s colonial past to the present in 2016. Through the unwavering spirit of our pioneering staff and students, the school grew from strength to strength, and built up the rich heritage and traditions that present Victorians enjoy. Today, Victoria School is one the top schools in Singapore, a school known for the emphasis on character and leadership excellence.

      <p><img src="/images/Kampong-Glam.jpg"><br>Victoria School is the second oldest government secondary school in Singapore. It originated as an English class established in 1876 in Kampong Glam Malay Branch School.<br><br>Early colonial era education was more of a private, rather than government, concern. Charitable organisations, public-minded individuals and missionary bodies were among the early pioneers of formal Malay and English education. By the 1870s, the Straits Settlements Government decided to improve English language standards in schools.<b>[1]</b> The chief function of a “Branch English School” was to teach English language and the vernacular language (Malay for the case of Kampong Glam Malay School). This was part of the effort of the Straits Settlements to relieve the pressure of overcrowding at major schools like Raffles Institution in Singapore, and the Free Schools in Penang and Malacca. The branch schools catered to boys of all social classes who stayed further away from the larger English schools. The Kampong Glam Malay Branch School aimed to help Malays benefit from English education.<b>[2]</b><br><br><b>[1]</b> Ernest Cheong, “Victoria School in Singapore 1976-1987” (BA Honours Thesis, National University of Singapore 1987/88), 5.<br><b>[2]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 8.</p>

    <label for="accordion2">Syed Alwi Road (1897 - 1993)</label>
    <div>
      <p><img src="/images/Syed-Alwi-Road.jpg"><br>In 1897, Kampong Glam Malay Branch School merged with Kampong Glam Malay School. The school moved to Syed Alwi Road, which was close to Victoria Bridge. Hence, the school’s name was changed to Victoria Bridge School.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/Photos-01.jpg"><br>Victoria Bridge School was a preparatory school to aided English secondary schools and Raffles Institution. Raffles Institution was the only government secondary school back then. The conversion of Victoria Bridge School into a secondary school was considered, but it was decided that Victoria Bridge School was more effective as a feeder school. In 1909, Victoria Bridge School started classes at Standard Five, as Raffles Institution faced capacity challenges. Until 1930, the school only had primary classes from Primary One to Standard Five. Victoria Bridge School’s enrolment gradually increased, due to growing demand for English education and education policies relating to Raffles Institution. By 1925, the student enrolment reached 705, beyond the government’s recommended capacity of 560. There were official school holidays such as the King’s birthday and Empire Day. Separate holidays were given to different ethnic groups for their respective festivals.<b>[3]</b><br><br>In 1930, Victoria Afternoon School began, catering to students who could not progress to Raffles Institution after passing Standard Five and to those who left school to provide spaces for students of normal ability and age. Victoria Afternoon School was not part of Victoria Bridge School. However, as Victoria Bridge School’s headmaster was overall-in-charge, it was still part of Victoria School’s history. The afternoon classes ended in 1952. In 1931, during the period of Rev A.J Amery’s headship, Victoria Bridge School became the second government secondary school, as Raffles Institution faced continued capacity challenges.<b>[4]</b><br><br>Problems existed during the earlier period of Victoria Bridge School’s history. Just like the first campus, dust clouds blew into the classrooms occasionally. The school was also flooded on rainy days. There was overbearing stench from the nearby drain and mud and continuous street noises. During that era, students and parents were indifferent towards education. Attendance was poor. When employment opportunities arose, students left. Parents often appeared unconvinced of the benefits of letting their child complete an English education or were too poor to sustain their boys’ education beyond 13 years old. School staff was insufficient. In 1902, five teachers taught eight different standards. Some teachers faced absenteeism or misconduct problems. Salaries were meagre. Certified government teachers frequently left for better salaries.<b>[5]</b><br><br>To improve the quality of education, headmasters such as Mr P. A. Yearwood, Mr H. Laugher and Mr M. B. Brockwell, enforced stronger discipline and attendance. The earliest records of the uniformity in school dress were in 1929. These strengthened the school’s formal status, improved student attendance and resulted in positive student behaviour.<b>[6]</b> A prominent businessman then, Syed Ahmed bin Mohamed Alsagoff helped the school when he donated $1,000 to create a school library which was opened on 27 December 1929.<b>[7]</b><br><br>The principals further strengthened student character and morale through students’ involvement in games. New roles were created, such as team captains and games’ committees. These reinforced student identity and built the school’s image as a community.<b>[8]</b>When Mr. R.E. Smith became the headmaster (1911-1912), the first scout group, called the Sixth Troop, was formed under Mr. S. R. Williams, a Mathematics teacher. The first annual Sports Meet was held in 1915. In 1916, the first annual Speech Day was held and the first annual prize for academic achievements commenced. In 1929, the ‘House System’ was introduced to build the Victorian spirit.<b>[9]</b> To maintain discipline and develop leadership, the House Prefects were formed in 1930.<b>[10]</b><br><br><b>[3]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 20-24.<br><b>[4]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 25.<br><b>[5]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 14-18.<br><b>[6]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 18-19.<br><b>[7]</b> The Straits Times, 11 December 1929, 12.<br><b>[8]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 27.<br><b>[9]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 19-20.<br><b>[10]</b> “A Brief History of Victoria School,” The Victorian, 1986, 2.</p>

    <label for="accordion3">Tyrwhitt Road (1933 - 1984)</label>
    <div>
      <p><img src="/images/Tyrwhitt-Road-1024x700.jpg"><br>In 1933, the school moved to Tyrwhitt Road and became known as Victoria School. The school had more spacious classrooms with high ceilings and Roman-like columns. The surroundings were also cleaner.<b>[11]</b> The school had its first candidates for the Junior Cambridge Examination in 1933, and for the Senior Cambridge Examination in 1934.<b>[12]</b> In 1935, Victoria School phased out her primary classes to become a purely secondary school for her district.<b>[13]</b><br><br>Under Mr E. H. Wilson in 1938, the prefect badge was introduced. The School motto “Nil Sine Labore” (Latin), meaning “Nothing without Labour” also came into existence. At the Amateur Athletic Association finals in 1940, Ali bin Ahmad won the 100 yards in 10 seconds and his name appeared in the Hall of Fame.<b>[14]</b> In the years 1939 and 1940, the school won the Sir Arthur Young Cup in the Inter-School relay event. In 1941, the Old Victorians’ Association was established.<b>[15]</b><br><br>In June 1940, war drew near. Victoria School conducted blackout preparations and air raid drills were held.<b>[16]</b> In November 1941, then-headmaster, Mr E. H. Wilson, reported that Victoria School was contributing by serving as an Aid Raid Precaution post and training centre and as a depot and aid post for the Medical Auxiliary Services<b>[17]</b>.<br><img src="/images/Tyrwhitt-Road-Photos.jpg"><br>During the Japanese Occupation in 1942, Japanese troops occupied the school and did screening of the people. Some staff, including some British expatriates, were taken away and never seen again. Schools were renamed based on the streets where they were located, and were only allowed to reopen in mid-1942. Victoria School, was thus renamed as “Jalan Besar Boys’ School”, and became one of the many Japanese public schools. Mr S. R. Williams was headmaster during this challenging period. The curriculum consisted of Japanese reading, Japanese songs, arithmetic, nature study, agriculture and writing. The teaching of English continued despite it being frowned upon. School children attended a daily flag raising ceremony to the Japanese national anthem, the Kimigayo. Bows followed, first towards Tokyo and then towards the Principal. Physical drill was also carried out together with music broadcasted by Radio Taisho.<b>[18]</b> Food was scarce. All available school land was used for growing vegetables and tapioca. Teachers and students experienced hardship and improvised with what they had.<b>[19]</b><br><br>When war ended in 1945, Mr S. R. Williams gathered 16 boys and started classes again. Victoria School became one of the earliest schools to reopen, occupying the Kampong Glam Malay School premises from 1 Oct 1945, as the British Military Administration used the Tyrwhitt Road building as a temporary hospital. She only returned to the Tyrwhitt Road building in May 1946.<br><br>After the war, headmasters Reverend Colin King and Mr P. F. Howitt helmed Victoria School for brief periods and also oversaw the immediate post-war rehabilitation programme to restore the buildings and equipment. During this period, the Colonial Government launched a Ten Year Education Programme. The Old Victorians’ Association, with their expertise and resources, also contributed towards the school’s recovery.<br><br><b>[11]</b> Santokh Singh Grewal, “History of VS”, The Victorian, 1990, 24.<br><b>[12]</b> S.R.

F. Bomford became the headmaster in 1948. He planned the construction of the Science Block, which opened in 1950. The Science Block housed the General Science and Biology Laboratories, and were reputedly Singapore’s best school laboratories. Students from Raffles Girls’ School and St. Andrew’s School also came to attend the science classes.<b>[20]</b>Under Mr Bomford, Victoria School was the colony’s selected school to pioneer audio-visual teaching.<b>[21]</b> Our annual Victoria School magazine also began its publication in 1948.
