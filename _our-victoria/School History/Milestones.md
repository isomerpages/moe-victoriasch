# **Milestones**

Victoria School grew, just like her students. She grew from Singaporeâ€™s colonial past to the present in 2016. Through the unwavering spirit of our pioneering staff and students, the school grew from strength to strength, and built up the rich heritage and traditions that present Victorians enjoy. Today, Victoria School is one the top schools in Singapore, a school known for the emphasis on character and leadership excellence.
