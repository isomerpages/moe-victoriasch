# **Milestones**

Victoria School grew, just like her students. She grew from Singapore’s colonial past to the present in 2016. Through the unwavering spirit of our pioneering staff and students, the school grew from strength to strength, and built up the rich heritage and traditions that present Victorians enjoy. Today, Victoria School is one the top schools in Singapore, a school known for the emphasis on character and leadership excellence.

      <p><img src="/images/Kampong-Glam.jpg"><br>Victoria School is the second oldest government secondary school in Singapore. It originated as an English class established in 1876 in Kampong Glam Malay Branch School.<br><br>Early colonial era education was more of a private, rather than government, concern. Charitable organisations, public-minded individuals and missionary bodies were among the early pioneers of formal Malay and English education. By the 1870s, the Straits Settlements Government decided to improve English language standards in schools.<b>[1]</b> The chief function of a “Branch English School” was to teach English language and the vernacular language (Malay for the case of Kampong Glam Malay School). This was part of the effort of the Straits Settlements to relieve the pressure of overcrowding at major schools like Raffles Institution in Singapore, and the Free Schools in Penang and Malacca. The branch schools catered to boys of all social classes who stayed further away from the larger English schools. The Kampong Glam Malay Branch School aimed to help Malays benefit from English education.<b>[2]</b><br><br><b>[1]</b> Ernest Cheong, “Victoria School in Singapore 1976-1987” (BA Honours Thesis, National University of Singapore 1987/88), 5.<br><b>[2]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 8.</p>

    <div>
      <p><img src="/images/Syed-Alwi-Road.jpg"><br>In 1897, Kampong Glam Malay Branch School merged with Kampong Glam Malay School. The school moved to Syed Alwi Road, which was close to Victoria Bridge. Hence, the school’s name was changed to Victoria Bridge School.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/Photos-01.jpg"><br>Victoria Bridge School was a preparatory school to aided English secondary schools and Raffles Institution. Raffles Institution was the only government secondary school back then. The conversion of Victoria Bridge School into a secondary school was considered, but it was decided that Victoria Bridge School was more effective as a feeder school. In 1909, Victoria Bridge School started classes at Standard Five, as Raffles Institution faced capacity challenges. Until 1930, the school only had primary classes from Primary One to Standard Five. Victoria Bridge School’s enrolment gradually increased, due to growing demand for English education and education policies relating to Raffles Institution. By 1925, the student enrolment reached 705, beyond the government’s recommended capacity of 560. There were official school holidays such as the King’s birthday and Empire Day. Separate holidays were given to different ethnic groups for their respective festivals.<b>[3]</b><br><br>In 1930, Victoria Afternoon School began, catering to students who could not progress to Raffles Institution after passing Standard Five and to those who left school to provide spaces for students of normal ability and age. Victoria Afternoon School was not part of Victoria Bridge School. However, as Victoria Bridge School’s headmaster was overall-in-charge, it was still part of Victoria School’s history. The afternoon classes ended in 1952. In 1931, during the period of Rev A.J Amery’s headship, Victoria Bridge School became the second government secondary school, as Raffles Institution faced continued capacity challenges.<b>[4]</b><br><br>Problems existed during the earlier period of Victoria Bridge School’s history. Just like the first campus, dust clouds blew into the classrooms occasionally. The school was also flooded on rainy days. There was overbearing stench from the nearby drain and mud and continuous street noises. During that era, students and parents were indifferent towards education. Attendance was poor. When employment opportunities arose, students left. Parents often appeared unconvinced of the benefits of letting their child complete an English education or were too poor to sustain their boys’ education beyond 13 years old. School staff was insufficient. In 1902, five teachers taught eight different standards. Some teachers faced absenteeism or misconduct problems. Salaries were meagre. Certified government teachers frequently left for better salaries.<b>[5]</b><br><br>To improve the quality of education, headmasters such as Mr P. A. Yearwood, Mr H. Laugher and Mr M. B. Brockwell, enforced stronger discipline and attendance. The earliest records of the uniformity in school dress were in 1929. These strengthened the school’s formal status, improved student attendance and resulted in positive student behaviour.<b>[6]</b> A prominent businessman then, Syed Ahmed bin Mohamed Alsagoff helped the school when he donated $1,000 to create a school library which was opened on 27 December 1929.<b>[7]</b><br><br>The principals further strengthened student character and morale through students’ involvement in games. New roles were created, such as team captains and games’ committees. These reinforced student identity and built the school’s image as a community.<b>[8]</b>When Mr. R.E. Smith became the headmaster (1911-1912), the first scout group, called the Sixth Troop, was formed under Mr. S. R. Williams, a Mathematics teacher. The first annual Sports Meet was held in 1915. In 1916, the first annual Speech Day was held and the first annual prize for academic achievements commenced. In 1929, the ‘House System’ was introduced to build the Victorian spirit.<b>[9]</b> To maintain discipline and develop leadership, the House Prefects were formed in 1930.<b>[10]</b><br><br><b>[3]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 20-24.<br><b>[4]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 25.<br><b>[5]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 14-18.<br><b>[6]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 18-19.<br><b>[7]</b> The Straits Times, 11 December 1929, 12.<br><b>[8]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 27.<br><b>[9]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 19-20.<br><b>[10]</b> “A Brief History of Victoria School,” The Victorian, 1986, 2.</p>
