# **Milestones**

Victoria School grew, just like her students. She grew from Singapore’s colonial past to the present in 2016. Through the unwavering spirit of our pioneering staff and students, the school grew from strength to strength, and built up the rich heritage and traditions that present Victorians enjoy. Today, Victoria School is one the top schools in Singapore, a school known for the emphasis on character and leadership excellence.

      <p><img src="/images/Kampong-Glam.jpg"><br>Victoria School is the second oldest government secondary school in Singapore. It originated as an English class established in 1876 in Kampong Glam Malay Branch School.<br><br>Early colonial era education was more of a private, rather than government, concern. Charitable organisations, public-minded individuals and missionary bodies were among the early pioneers of formal Malay and English education. By the 1870s, the Straits Settlements Government decided to improve English language standards in schools.<b>[1]</b> The chief function of a “Branch English School” was to teach English language and the vernacular language (Malay for the case of Kampong Glam Malay School). This was part of the effort of the Straits Settlements to relieve the pressure of overcrowding at major schools like Raffles Institution in Singapore, and the Free Schools in Penang and Malacca. The branch schools catered to boys of all social classes who stayed further away from the larger English schools. The Kampong Glam Malay Branch School aimed to help Malays benefit from English education.<b>[2]</b><br><br><b>[1]</b> Ernest Cheong, “Victoria School in Singapore 1976-1987” (BA Honours Thesis, National University of Singapore 1987/88), 5.<br><b>[2]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 8.</p>

    <label for="accordion2">Syed Alwi Road (1897 - 1993)</label>
    <div>
      <p><img src="/images/Syed-Alwi-Road.jpg"><br>In 1897, Kampong Glam Malay Branch School merged with Kampong Glam Malay School. The school moved to Syed Alwi Road, which was close to Victoria Bridge. Hence, the school’s name was changed to Victoria Bridge School.</p>
			<p><img src="/images/Photos-01.jpg"><br>Victoria Bridge School was a preparatory school to aided English secondary schools and Raffles Institution. Raffles Institution was the only government secondary school back then. The conversion of Victoria Bridge School into a secondary school was considered, but it was decided that Victoria Bridge School was more effective as a feeder school. In 1909, Victoria Bridge School started classes at Standard Five, as Raffles Institution faced capacity challenges. Until 1930, the school only had primary classes from Primary One to Standard Five. Victoria Bridge School’s enrolment gradually increased, due to growing demand for English education and education policies relating to Raffles Institution. By 1925, the student enrolment reached 705, beyond the government’s recommended capacity of 560. There were official school holidays such as the King’s birthday and Empire Day. Separate holidays were given to different ethnic groups for their respective festivals.<b>[3]</b><br><br>In 1930, Victoria Afternoon School began, catering to students who could not progress to Raffles Institution after passing Standard Five and to those who left school to provide spaces for students of normal ability and age. Victoria Afternoon School was not part of Victoria Bridge School. However, as Victoria Bridge School’s headmaster was overall-in-charge, it was still part of Victoria School’s history. The afternoon classes ended in 1952. In 1931, during the period of Rev A.J Amery’s headship, Victoria Bridge School became the second government secondary school, as Raffles Institution faced continued capacity challenges.<b>[4]</b><br><br>Problems existed during the earlier period of Victoria Bridge School’s history. Just like the first campus, dust clouds blew into the classrooms occasionally. The school was also flooded on rainy days. There was overbearing stench from the nearby drain and mud and continuous street noises. During that era, students and parents were indifferent towards education. Attendance was poor. When employment opportunities arose, students left. Parents often appeared unconvinced of the benefits of letting their child complete an English education or were too poor to sustain their boys’ education beyond 13 years old. School staff was insufficient. In 1902, five teachers taught eight different standards. Some teachers faced absenteeism or misconduct problems. Salaries were meagre. Certified government teachers frequently left for better salaries.<b>[5]</b><br><br>To improve the quality of education, headmasters such as Mr P. A. Yearwood, Mr H. Laugher and Mr M. B. Brockwell, enforced stronger discipline and attendance. The earliest records of the uniformity in school dress were in 1929. These strengthened the school’s formal status, improved student attendance and resulted in positive student behaviour.<b>[6]</b> A prominent businessman then, Syed Ahmed bin Mohamed Alsagoff helped the school when he donated $1,000 to create a school library which was opened on 27 December 1929.<b>[7]</b><br><br>The principals further strengthened student character and morale through students’ involvement in games. New roles were created, such as team captains and games’ committees. These reinforced student identity and built the school’s image as a community.<b>[8]</b>When Mr. R.E. Smith became the headmaster (1911-1912), the first scout group, called the Sixth Troop, was formed under Mr. S. R. Williams, a Mathematics teacher. The first annual Sports Meet was held in 1915. In 1916, the first annual Speech Day was held and the first annual prize for academic achievements commenced. In 1929, the ‘House System’ was introduced to build the Victorian spirit.<b>[9]</b> To maintain discipline and develop leadership, the House Prefects were formed in 1930.<b>[10]</b><br><br><b>[3]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 20-24.<br><b>[4]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 25.<br><b>[5]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 14-18.<br><b>[6]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 18-19.<br><b>[7]</b> The Straits Times, 11 December 1929, 12.<br><b>[8]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 27.<br><b>[9]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 19-20.<br><b>[10]</b> “A Brief History of Victoria School,” The Victorian, 1986, 2.</p>

    <div>
      <p><img src="/images/Tyrwhitt-Road-1024x700.jpg"><br>In 1933, the school moved to Tyrwhitt Road and became known as Victoria School. The school had more spacious classrooms with high ceilings and Roman-like columns. The surroundings were also cleaner.<b>[11]</b> The school had its first candidates for the Junior Cambridge Examination in 1933, and for the Senior Cambridge Examination in 1934.<b>[12]</b> In 1935, Victoria School phased out her primary classes to become a purely secondary school for her district.<b>[13]</b><br><br>Under Mr E. H. Wilson in 1938, the prefect badge was introduced. The School motto “Nil Sine Labore” (Latin), meaning “Nothing without Labour” also came into existence. At the Amateur Athletic Association finals in 1940, Ali bin Ahmad won the 100 yards in 10 seconds and his name appeared in the Hall of Fame.<b>[14]</b> In the years 1939 and 1940, the school won the Sir Arthur Young Cup in the Inter-School relay event. In 1941, the Old Victorians’ Association was established.<b>[15]</b><br><br>In June 1940, war drew near. Victoria School conducted blackout preparations and air raid drills were held.<b>[16]</b> In November 1941, then-headmaster, Mr E. H. Wilson, reported that Victoria School was contributing by serving as an Aid Raid Precaution post and training centre and as a depot and aid post for the Medical Auxiliary Services<b>[17]</b>.<br><img src="/images/Tyrwhitt-Road-Photos.jpg"><br>During the Japanese Occupation in 1942, Japanese troops occupied the school and did screening of the people. Some staff, including some British expatriates, were taken away and never seen again. Schools were renamed based on the streets where they were located, and were only allowed to reopen in mid-1942. Victoria School, was thus renamed as “Jalan Besar Boys’ School”, and became one of the many Japanese public schools. Mr S. R. Williams was headmaster during this challenging period. The curriculum consisted of Japanese reading, Japanese songs, arithmetic, nature study, agriculture and writing. The teaching of English continued despite it being frowned upon. School children attended a daily flag raising ceremony to the Japanese national anthem, the Kimigayo. Bows followed, first towards Tokyo and then towards the Principal. Physical drill was also carried out together with music broadcasted by Radio Taisho.<b>[18]</b> Food was scarce. All available school land was used for growing vegetables and tapioca. Teachers and students experienced hardship and improvised with what they had.<b>[19]</b><br><br>When war ended in 1945, Mr S. R. Williams gathered 16 boys and started classes again. Victoria School became one of the earliest schools to reopen, occupying the Kampong Glam Malay School premises from 1 Oct 1945, as the British Military Administration used the Tyrwhitt Road building as a temporary hospital. She only returned to the Tyrwhitt Road building in May 1946.<br><br>After the war, headmasters Reverend Colin King and Mr P. F. Howitt helmed Victoria School for brief periods and also oversaw the immediate post-war rehabilitation programme to restore the buildings and equipment. During this period, the Colonial Government launched a Ten Year Education Programme. The Old Victorians’ Association, with their expertise and resources, also contributed towards the school’s recovery.<br><br><b>[11]</b> Santokh Singh Grewal, “History of VS”, The Victorian, 1990, 24.<br><b>[12]</b> S.R.

F. Bomford became the headmaster in 1948. He planned the construction of the Science Block, which opened in 1950. The Science Block housed the General Science and Biology Laboratories, and were reputedly Singapore’s best school laboratories. Students from Raffles Girls’ School and St. Andrew’s School also came to attend the science classes.<b>[20]</b>Under Mr Bomford, Victoria School was the colony’s selected school to pioneer audio-visual teaching.<b>[21]</b> Our annual Victoria School magazine also began its publication in 1948.

			<p><img src="/images/Photos-03.jpg"><br>Due to the Japanese invasion and occupation, those who sat for the Senior Cambridge Examination in December 1941 waited till 1946 to know their results. Our school did well, with 84 percent passes and 16 percent obtaining Grades 1 to 3.</>[22]</b> In 1951, the first Pre-University (then called the Post School Certificate) classes started and admitted girls.<b>[23]</b> In 1955, 99.5% passed the Cambridge Overseas School Certificate Examinations, making it Singapore’s best boys’ school. In 1957, the school had the best results in the University Entrance Examinations. In addition, two of the three Queen’s Scholarships were awarded to Victorians Teh Ee Kheng (for Arts) and Yap Choon Teck (for Science).<b>[24]</b></p>
		<p><img src="/images/Photos-04.jpg"><br>Our school song was composed and set to the music in the early 1950s. Mr Bomford contributed his energy and talent to make Victoria a top school. Upon his death in 1953, grateful Victorians organised the Bomford Memorial Fund in 1954 (now administered by the Old Victorians’ Association) to award outstanding pupils.<b>[25]</b><br><br><b>[22]</b> “History of Victoria School,” The Victorian, 1969, 20.<br><b>[23]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 41.<br><b>[24]</b> “Milestones of Victoria School”, Victorian, 1997, 192.<br><b>[25]</b> “A Brief History of Victoria School”, The Victorian, 1985, 3.</p>
		<p><img src="/images/Photos-05.jpg"><br>In 1954, Mr. M Campbell was appointed Principal of the school. During his stewardship, our school attained high academic honours. Mr. Campbell left in 1958 and within a period of seven years, we had eight principals.<br><br>From April 1966 to January 1971, Mr. A Kannayson became the Principal. This was a period of change and growth for the school. The school’s enrolment in 1967 was 1672 students for two sessions, although her capacity was for 400.<b>[26]</b><br><br>In 1966, a one-year $660,000 upgrade began. The extension consisted of four new laboratories, a new hall, canteen, staffroom, 14 classrooms, eight toilets and a basketball court. In 1969, the old building was modified for a bigger library and an Educational Television hall. The school could then accommodate 11 Pre-university and 11 Secondary Four classes in the morning; and 8 Secondary Three, 10 Secondary Two, and 7 Secondary One classes in the afternoon.<b>[27]</b> Victoria School’s GCE ‘O’ Level passes rose from 50.1% in 1971 to 71.55% in 1975.<b>[28]</b>  During his time, the school also made great strides in extra-curricular activities. For example, in the Track and Field competition in 1981, she won three age divisions in the National Athletics Meet, a first in the history of schools’ sports. There was a considerable improvement in student and staff morale.<br><br><b>[26]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 63.<br><b>[27]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 63-64.<br><b>[28]</b> Cheong, “Victoria School.”, 63-65.</p>

The brightest Victorians went to junior colleges to study, instead of continuing with the pre-university courses. To cope with the competition provided by the junior colleges, and in pursuit of providing quality education, the Old Victorians’ Association and the Victoria Executive Committee worked together to establish Victoria Junior College, where Victorians could further their junior college education.<b>[29]</b><br><br><b>[29]</b> “Speech by Dr. Ong Chit Chung, Chairman, Victoria Executive & Advisory Committees at Victoria School’s 127th Speech Day, 26 July 2003,” The Victorian, 2003, 70-71.</p>

			<p>insert pictures<br>Ministry of Information and the Arts Collection, courtesy of National Archives of Singapore<br><br>During the late 1980s and early 1990s, the new challenge of independent schools arose. Independent schools are granted greater flexibility than other schools to design their own school curriculum and programmes, choose their own students and set their own school fees. Their school fees are therefore usually higher than that of government-run schools. The VEC deliberated, and decided to remain as a government school, true to the original mission of providing good education to a wide spectrum of students.<br><br>On 11 July 1987, the first Victoria Challenge was inaugurated by Mr Nicholas Tang, then Principal of Victoria School. This quadrennial event allows classes to identify tasks that contribute tangibly to the school and community. This contribution can be either aesthetic or ‘atmospheric’. The Victoria Challenge is for classes to plan tasks and pledge completion within the allocated twenty-four hours. As part of the tradition, there is a school-wide challenge that the whole school participates in to benefit the community. Through Victorian Challenge, Mr Tang wanted Victorians to know that they can make tangible contributions to the family, school, community, work and nation. He hoped the event would build student pride, identity, morale and confidence. Over time, the Victoria Challenge became an event that all Victorians look forward to in their Victorian years. Every Victorian will only go through it once in his four years of secondary school education.<br><br>To help every Victorian achieve an all-round performance and to provide motivation for better results Victoria School pioneered the Victorian Profile certificate in 1991 under Mr Tan Tiek Kwee’s leadership.

In 2001, Victoria School became the seventh Secondary Gifted Education Programme centre and hosted the Gifted Education Programme from 2001-2005.<br><br>Approaching the new millennium, the Victoria Executive Committee worked towards the revitalization of Victoria School. The Victoria Executive Committee decided that Victoria School would attract even better students by moving to the east, closer to Victoria Junior College in Marine Parade. The Siglap Link site, where the Marine Parade Bus Terminal stood at, was favoured. However, the government planned to zone this prime land for condominium development. Through the efforts of the Victoria Executive Committee, approval was granted by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of National Development for part of the land to be allocated for the new Victoria School campus at Siglap. To enhance the school’s competitiveness, a hostel was integrated as part of the school design<br><br><b>[31]</b> The Victorian, 1993, 51</p>
