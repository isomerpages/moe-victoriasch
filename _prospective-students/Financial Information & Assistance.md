### Financial Information Assistance

**School fees and Financial Assistance Application**

The Ministry of Education and the school provide financial assistance (MOE FAS) to Singaporean students to cover essential expenses such as fees, textbooks, and meals. Applications can be submitted online. 

Regarding school fees, Victoria School’s autonomous school fee is $3 per month, in addition to the standard monthly fees and miscellaneous fees set by MOE. Use our fees checker to find out the amount and structure of monthly fees for Singapore Citizens, Permanent Residents or international students [here](https://www.moe.gov.sg/financial-matters/fees).

### Scholarships

At Victoria School, we have scholarships and bursaries to recognise outstanding students who have achieved performance excellence.

**Gentleman, Professional, Sportsman (GPS) Sports Scholarship**

The scholarship recognises our Victorians with strong CCA achievements at an individual and team level. Our GPS scholar is a role-model as a team player and leader. Each GPS Scholarship, tenable for six years for the duration of study at VS-VJC, is valued at S$1000 per awardee each year. The recipients are the most deserving students with sports talents who join us at Secondary 1. The scholarship is renewed every year for these selected students when they continue to demonstrate good attitude, consistency in training, leadership ability, teamwork and a strong community spirit.

**Gentleman, Professional, Sportsman (GPS) Bursary**

The GPS Bursary, with a value of S$500 each, is an initiative by Victoria School and the Old Victorians’ Association to support our Victorians in achieving their goals. The criteria for application is based on gross household income, background, personal circumstances and exemplary academic, leadership and CCA records.

The application form can be obtained from the school General Office or downloaded [here](/files/GPS-Bursary-Application-Form.pdf). Successful applicants will be informed of the outcome by end-November.
