    <div>
      <ol><li>What are the unique features of the VCA IP? How is it different from the IP offered in other schools?</li><p>The VCA IP draws on the outstanding academic track records of VS and Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and builds on the very successful Victoria Integrated Programme (VIP) in VJC which was launched since 2005. It will be a programme that stretches students’ potential, demands their full participation and develops their individual voice and identity.<br><br>Besides the core curriculum, a signature programme of the VCA is the Imagineering Programme, which aims to inspire students to become social innovators with the passion, attributes and ability to imagine and engineer innovative solutions to social problems. Other key programmes include the Helmsman programme for character development and life skills; the Beyond Borders programme for overseas exposure; and the Electives, consisting of a wide range of subject interests which students can choose from to further develop their creativity, communication and thinking skills which are all important 21st century competencies.<br><br>In the co-curricular arena, students in VS and CGSS will experience the ethos and privilege of an all-boys and an all-girls education respectively and at the same time, they will also participate in joint programmes to broaden their social outlook. In addition, the students will enjoy the full range of co-curricular activities such as sports, performing arts, uniformed groups and experience the schools’ leadership development programme.</p>
