### Appeal for School Transfer (Primary 6 Students) (applicable after the release of Secondary 1 Posting Results)

School admissions are based on merit in the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise. Posting decisions are based on objective and transparent measures of academic merit i.e. PSLE scores. Appeals that take place after the S1 Posting Exercise must be aligned to these principles, in order to be fair to other admitted students.

Primary 6 students who have applied to Victoria School during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal to be considered for transfer to Victoria School. These students appealing for admission to VS after the release of the Secondary 1 Posting result have to meet the school’s cut-off points (COP) for the O Level or Integrated Programme.

The cut-off points for Victoria School this year are as follows:
* O-Level: AL 9
* Integrated Programme: AL 8

(\*Note: Students admitted to a school through the DSA-Sec Exercise will not be allowed to transfer to another school after the release of the PSLE results. They are expected to honour the commitment to the posted DSA school for the duration of the programme admitted to.)

**Medical Appeal Application**

The Medical Appeal Exercise (MAE) only applies to students with serious medical conditions. Students must produce any documentary evidence or the reason for transfer:

a. Serious Medical Conditions. Students with persistent or serious illness e.g. chronic heart conditions, kidney problems. An official letter from a certified doctor must be attached to the application.

b. Severe Physical Impairments. Students with physical impairments. An assessment from qualified medical professional(s) of the student's conditions and needs should be submitted. The assessment should clearly describe the extent of impairments (temporary/permanent) and the type of assistive device that the student is currently using (e.g. those requiring permanent use of a wheelchair).

Victoria School is not in the list of schools which can be selected for MAE. If you would like to apply for a transfer out of Victoria School under MAE, please file your appeals at the posted school (Victoria School) in person or email [Victoria_sch@moe.edu.sg](mailto:Victoria_sch@moe.edu.sg) by **12pm** on **19 December 2024**. The MAE application form can only be given to parents upon request. Each student is only allowed to submit one application.

**Non-Medical Appeal Application**

**Application period**

The application period is from the **day of release of Secondary 1 Posting results (0900 hours) to 23 December 2024, 1700 hours.**

Late or incomplete application will not be considered. Only shortlisted applicants will be informed.

**How to apply?**

Application is to be done strictly via this [link](https://form.gov.sg/675fe6a02e0ebc331042b40e).

For your convenience, it is not necessary to submit any hardcopy appeal form personally.

**What happens after I apply?**

All applicants will be put on the waiting list. The school’s decision will be made after the vacancies are ascertained following the release of the Secondary 1 posting results and deadline for online appeal application is over. However, based on past years’ experience, the number of places are limited.

Shortlisted applicants may be required to sit for entrance tests and/or interview. They will also be required to produce certified true copies of their documents.

**Pending the outcome of appeal, all applicants are required to report to the school that they are posted to by the Ministry of Education on Secondary 1 Registration Day.** VS will assist to facilitate the transfer process if the applicant is eventually successful.

**When will I know the outcome of my application?**

Successful applicants will be informed after **31 December 2024**.

The decision of the school’s Admissions Committee is final and the school will not enter into discussion with the applicants regarding its decision
