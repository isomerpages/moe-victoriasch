# **Direct School Admissions to Sec 1 (Year 1)**

### Direct School Admission to 2026 Secondary 1

**Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise**

1\.  The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

2\.  Primary 6 students have a choice of whether or not to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise. If they choose not to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise, they will continue to participate in the Secondary One Posting Exercise after the release of the PSLE results. For more information on the DSA-Sec Exercise, refer to:&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)
