# **Direct School Admissions to Sec 1 (Year 1)**

### Direct School Admission to 2024 Secondary 1

**Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise**

1\.  The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.

2\.  Primary 6 students have a choice of whether or not to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise. If they choose not to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise, they will continue to participate in the Secondary One Posting Exercise after the release of the PSLE results. For more information on the DSA-Sec Exercise, refer to:&nbsp;[https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)

**Victoria School: Dual-Track – O Level Programme and Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme**

3\.  At Victoria School (VS), we nurture outstanding students into Gentlemen, Professionals and Sportsmen who make tangible contributions to their family, work, community and nation. Our students come from over 80 primary schools in Singapore.

4\.  As a dual-track school, students choose between our 4-year ‘O’ Level Programme or the 6-year Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP) jointly offered with Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and our affiliated college, Victoria Junior College (VJC).&nbsp; Students in the VCA IP will spend four years in VS and two years in VJC leading to the GCE ‘A’ Level Examinations.

**DSA-Sec to Victoria School: Domains**

5\.  In line with the school’s focus on holistic development and to nurture diversity of talents, we are looking for promising Primary 6 boys who demonstrate talent and ability in Language and Science, Technology, Engineering &amp; Mathematics (STEM), Leadership, Aesthetics or Sports. Successful applicants will join VS in January 2024.

6\.  Students will be assessed on their ability in the talent area and academic ability so as to ensure that they benefit from the rigorous total curriculum offered at VS. Generally, students should have:   
    a.  High intellectual potential and ability,      
		b.  High levels of motivation and commitment to excellence in   academic and co-curricular areas (including but not limited to co-curricular activities and community involvement),      
    c.  Leadership potential with the commitment to serve others,       
		d.  A passion for life and learning, and   
    e.  Potential to contribute to the VS community.

Application to VS during the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise
(for unsuccessful DSA applicants or students who did not take part in DSA)

Applicants who are unsuccessful in the DSA Exercise or who did not take part in the DSA-Sec Exercise may still apply to the O Level Programme or Integrated Programme at VS using their PSLE results under MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise.

There are different option codes for the ‘O’ level Programme and Integrated Programme at VS. Students should indicate if they are selecting the

* ‘O’ level programme (3014) or
* Integrated Programme (9151).  

For example, a student may choose VS (Integrated Programme) as the first choice and VS (‘O’ Level Programme) as the second choice.  The PSLE cut-off achievement level scores for both tracks vary every year depending on the PSLE achievement level scores of the applicants in that year.
