# **Direct School Admissions to Sec 1 (Year 1)**

### Direct School Admission to 2023 Secondary 1

**Direct School Admission – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise**

1.  The DSA-Sec Exercise was introduced by the Ministry of Education in 2004. It seeks to promote holistic education and provide students an opportunity to demonstrate a more diverse range of achievements and talents in seeking admission to a secondary school. The selection will be based on their achievements and talents before the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE) results are released. Parents and students are encouraged to choose schools wisely based on the student’s aptitudes and strengths, bearing in mind the school’s academic and non-academic requirements, and the programmes available to develop the area of talent.
2.  Primary 6 students have a choice of whether or not to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise. If they choose not to participate in the DSA-Sec Exercise, they will continue to participate in the Secondary One Posting Exercise after the release of the PSLE results. For more information on the DSA-Sec Exercise, refer to: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec](https://www.moe.gov.sg/dsa-sec)

**Victoria School: Dual-Track – O Level Programme and Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme**

As a dual-track school, students choose between our 4-year ‘O’ Level Programme or the 6-year Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP) jointly offered with Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and our affiliated college, Victoria Junior College (VJC).  Students in the VCA IP will spend four years in VS and two years in VJC leading to the GCE ‘A’ Level Examinations.
