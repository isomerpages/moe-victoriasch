### Admission to Level 1 – Secondary 1 Posting Exercise

**What is the Secondary 1 Posting exercise?**

The annual Sec 1 Posting Exercise is conducted by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to post Primary Six (P6) students from our mainstream schools who have passed their Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) to a secondary school taking into consideration their PSLE results, choices of schools and available vacancies. For more information, please refer to this MOE website:[https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/secondary-one-posting-exercise](https://www.moe.gov.sg/admissions/secondary-one-posting-exercise)

**Who can participate?**

All P6 students from our mainstream schools who pass the PSLE (except those who have been successfully allocated a secondary school place via the Direct School Admissions – Secondary (DSA-Sec) Exercise) are allowed to take part in the annual Secondary 1 Posting Exercise. Successful DSA students who are eligible to opt for Third Language and/or Course Option can do so using the S1 Internet System (S1-IS).

**Dual Track Programme at Victoria School**

As a dual track school, students choose between our 4-year ‘O’ level Programme or the 6-year Victoria-Cedar Alliance Integrated Programme (VCA IP) jointly offered with Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and our affiliated college, Victoria Junior College (VJC).  For the VCA IP, students will spend four years in VS and the final two years in Victoria Junior College (VJC), leading to the GCE ‘A’ level examination.  

For the Secondary 1 Posting Exercise, applicants are to note that there are different option codes for the ‘O’ level programme and IP.  Students and parents should indicate if they are selecting the ‘O’ level programme (3014) or IP (9151). For example, a student may choose VS (IP) as a first choice and VS (‘O’ Level Programme) as a second choice.
