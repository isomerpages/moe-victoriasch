<h1><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></h1>
<h2>Our Beliefs</h2>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Victorians learn best in an environment of order and discipline. They
also need care, encouragement and space to learn from mistakes and grow
in character.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discipline is an educative process. Its goal is to instil self-discipline
and good character so that every Victorian becomes a Gentleman, Sportsman
and Leader.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consequences provide opportunities for learning and responsibility, not
punishment. We apply them fairly, firmly and appropriately to guide Victorians
in living out our school’s direction.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Expectations</h2>
<p>Every Victorian sets high expectations for himself as a Gentleman, Sportsman
and Leader who serves and leads his family, community and country.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>As Gentlemen, Victorians act with integrity and take responsibility for
their decisions and actions. They learn from experiences and grow into
kind, respectful and upright young men who uphold our school values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Sportsmen, Victorians exercise self-discipline and take personal responsibility.
They build strong relationships through empathy, cooperation and understanding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Leaders, Victorians serve others and contribute to a safe and positive
learning environment. They honour school rules, value community and uplift
those around them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Our Approach</h2>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Our approach to student management reflects our commitment to student
wellbeing and holistic development. We focus on helping Victorians learn
and grow from their actions. We are firm in our standards and fair in our
judgement.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every student is treated with dignity, impartiality and empathy. We uphold
clear standards consistently to nurture integrity and resilience.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We set and communicate high standards of behaviour that reflect our school
direction and values. When misconduct occurs, we address it promptly and
fairly, taking time to understand the context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opportunities for reflection and restoration are built into our approach.
Applied with proportionality and compassion, they help Victorians take
responsibility, repair trust and strengthen relationships.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of Follow-Up Actions/Consequences</p>

committed a serious offence, his parents/guardians will be invited to the
school for a discussion.

stating further consequences should the student continues to violate the
school rules.
<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Detention/School Service</strong>:
Detention/Corrective Work is a consequence for minor offences and takes
precedence over CCA and enrichment lessons. Victorians are expected to
exercise accountability by informing relevant teachers should they be absent
from CCA and enrichment lessons.

ability to manage the student.
<br>10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Referral to Law Enforcement Agencies</strong>:
There may be occasions when the school will have to seek the assistance
of the Singapore Police Force, Central Narcotics Bureau or other law enforcement
agencies when it is required by law or when the safety and security of
students and staff are at risk.
<br>11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Police Case</strong>: In
cases where a Victorian is involved in a police case, the school will take
the necessary disciplinary action after the police have concluded their
investigations.
<br>12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Disciplinary Record</strong>:
A disciplinary record will be kept in each Victorian’s dossier. Details
of the nature of the offence and the disciplinary action taken will be
recorded. A Victorian with a poor disciplinary record will not receive
a testimonial or be considered for award nomination. His Conduct Grade
will also be impacted.</p>
<p>The list of offences and disciplinary consequences stated above are not
exhaustive and are subjected to changes.</p>
