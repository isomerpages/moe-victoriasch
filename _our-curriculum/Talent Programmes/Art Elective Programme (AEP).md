#### Overview

The Art Elective Programme (AEP) is designed to enable pupils with both academic and artistic abilities to undertake a challenging Art programme. It aims to develop pupils’ conceptual and analytical faculties by placing equal emphasis on both the practical and theoretical aspects of Art. Pupils are encouraged to explore their thoughts, feelings and ideas through a variety of art practices. Pupils also develop skills to make critical judgements about artworks and art practices through the study of visual arts.

#### Programme

The AEP is a four-year course that prepares pupils for the GCE ‘O’ Level Higher Art Examination. Pupils selected for the AEP will take Higher Art in place of Design & Technology and Home Economics at the lower secondary level. In the mainstream schools, AEP pupils are expected to complete the four-year course and offer Higher Art as a subject for examination at the GCE ‘O’ Level. AEP pupils in the Integrated Programme (IP) schools offer H2 and H3 Art as examination subjects at the GCE ‘A’ Level.  
AEP is offered only at the following schools:
