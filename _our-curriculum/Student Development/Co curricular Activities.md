### Introduction
Click [here](/files/2023-cca-deployment-schedule_sem-1-for-publishing-26-jan-23.pdf) to view the 2023 list of CCA Teacher-in-charge and Schedule.

The Co-Curricular Activities develop students’ character, leadership and resilience, help them engender meaningful relationships, develop the skills and knowledge of their craft and imbue in them the spirit of sportsmanship.

### Diverse Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)
