### Introduction

The Co-Curricular Activities develop studentsâ€™ character, leadership and resilience, help them engender meaningful relationships, develop the skills and knowledge of their craft and imbue in them the spirit of sportsmanship.

### Diverse Co-Curricular Activities (CCA)
In all, we have almost 30 CCAs in four key areas of Sports & Games, Uniformed Groups, Performing Arts, and Clubs & Societies. All our CCAs are high performing and have garnered achievements at Zonal, National and International levels.
