### The Victorian Physical Domain

A healthy body and a healthy mind fuel the Victorian spirit and propel our students to perform and achieve excellence in their diverse talents. The Victoria Physical Education Programme enriches students in the key sports and games through the teaching of concepts and theories that support the physical activities. Students also develop a life-long penchant for recreational sports and games, and healthy management of their fitness and health.

Victorian Sportsmen who are passionate about sports have the opportunity to choose the Sports Excellence Programme to help them chart their aspiration towards sports talent management, sports science and physiological studies. In this specialised field of study, students offer Physical Education at the GCE ‘O’ Level Examination at the end of Secondary 4.
