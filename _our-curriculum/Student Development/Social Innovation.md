### Objectives and Programmes

##### Values in Action (VIA) through Social Innovation Programme

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support students’ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. This fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community.

Through VS Social Innovation Programme, being part of VIA, using Design Thinking methodology, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to innovate and contribute meaningfully to improve the lives of others. This is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education.

##### Benefits to Victorians and the community

*   Increase awareness of current issues in society
*   Nurture community and civic responsibility
*   Develop life skills
*   Encourage student initiative
*   Foster social and personal development
*   Provide meaningful services to our community


##### Approach

Students are encouraged to put values into practice within the context of real-life situations in the family, school, community, nation and the world. They will embrace their social roles as they interact with the world around them and act with consideration of the consequences of their actions on themselves and others.

Students can be involved in Social Innovation Projects by rendering services or solutions that meet the needs of the community. Solutions presented for implementation can be of the following:

Students are encouraged to initiate Social Innovation Projects based on their assessment of the needs of their community. This serves to promote active citizenry among our youth, and also bring about a greater sense of engagement and ownership. Through guided reflections, our students will also learn to emphathise with others in the community, be critical and innovative thinkers, and contribute to the community.
