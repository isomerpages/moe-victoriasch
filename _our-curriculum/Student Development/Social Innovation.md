### Objectives and Programmes

##### Values in Action (VIA) through Social Innovation Programme

Values in Action (VIA) are learning experiences that support studentsâ€™ development as socially responsible citizens who contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. This fosters student ownership over how they contribute to the community.

Through VS Social Innovation Programme, being part of VIA, using Design Thinking methodology, students reflect on their experience, the values they have put into practice, and how they can continue to innovate and contribute meaningfully to improve the lives of others. This is an important component of Character and Citizenship Education.
