### Character & Leadership
#### Character and Leadership Education (CLE)

Victoria School’s Character and Leadership Education (CLE) Programme is interwoven into all aspects of our students’ school life. Character Education is taught through the School’s Character and Citizenship Education lessons. It is also infused into our academic curriculum as part of the whole-school approach towards character education. In CCAs, character education is given priority as the boys are groomed to be disciplined team players and responsible leaders. Essentially, CLE aims to nurture compassionate, steadfast and principled young men who possess a sense of social responsibility and contribute positively to their family, community, nation and the world.
