			<p><h4>Character and Leadership Education (CLE)</h4></p>
			<p>Victoria School’s Character and Leadership Education (CLE) Programme is interwoven into all aspects of our students’ school life. Character Education is taught through the School’s Character and Citizenship Education lessons. It is also infused into our academic curriculum as part of the whole-school approach towards character education. In CCAs, character education is given priority as the boys are groomed to be disciplined team players and responsible leaders. Essentially, CLE aims to nurture compassionate, steadfast and principled young men who possess a sense of social responsibility and contribute positively to their family, community, nation and the world.</p>

      <p>Over the 3 ½ years in AV Club, students learn the use of the audio and visual equipment available in AV Club. More importantly for them is that they learn crucial life skills of which are not commonly found in everyday activities. They learn the importance of teamwork and coordination, trouble-shooting, decision-making and working toward a common goal in every opportunity. Besides being trained to remain steadfast in their roles and responsibilities during events, they learn the value of Ever-Readiness, our CCA motto which AV students are always ready to spring into action and show their initiative should the need arise, whether during morning assemblies, at dynamic events, and in everyday life.</p>
