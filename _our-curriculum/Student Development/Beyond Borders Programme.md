### Beyond Borders

This programme offers Victorians an experience that takes them on a discovery of the world outside their classroom and allows them to see things with new perspectives. We believe that for our students to have a deeper global awareness and understanding of other cultures, it is important that they have experiences beyond their personal borders. Through this process of discovery, our students develop a sense of belonging to something that is much bigger than themselves and find their own place in the world.

This experiential learning takes place locally and globally. Our younger students are taken through a local experience, exploring facets of Singapore which are often overlooked. Our older students embark on trips overseas to hone their understanding of other cultures, widen their horizons and gain more confidence in their cross-cultural interaction with others.
