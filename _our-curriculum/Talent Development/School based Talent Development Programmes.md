    <label for="accordion1">English Talent Development Programme</label>
    <div>
      <p>Victorians who excel in English are identified early by their teachers and mentored to develop their talents in writing and speaking. Talented students are selected to participate in various writing and oratorical programmes and contests, such as the Queen’s Commonwealth Essay Competition, Creative Arts Programme, YMCA Plain English Speaking Awards, and S Rajaratnam Leadership Series: Storytelling Competition. As part of their development, the students take on the role of emcees in school events and student journalists to cover major school or national events.</p>

    <label for="accordion2">Entrepreneurship Education Programme</label>
    <div>
      <p>The Entrepreneurship Education Programme aims to develop a creative and entrepreneurial mindset, as well as to equip students with basic business and entrepreneurial knowledge. Students participate in a range of entrepreneurship competitions and attachments to gain real-world entrepreneurial exposure and experience. Students learn Social Entrepreneurship through their experiences with charitable organisations in terms of the planning and financing in their daily operations.</p>
			<p>Our school has a tie up with the Spirit of Enterprising (SOE), which conducts programmes and organises activities, such as the Citi-YMCA Youth For Causes (YFC), for student participation. In addition, SOE arranges visits to companies and beneficiaries, most recently at the Koolwertz and Willing Hearts @ Chai Chee Community Centre respectively. At these platforms, students help out and learn how charitable organisations manage their daily manpower and financial issues. To learn from the experiences of professionals, students converse and engage with entrepreneurs, including our Old Victorians.</p>

    <label for="accordion3">Humanities Talent Development</label>
    <div>
      <p>The Humanities Talent Development Programme enhances the intellectual experience and achievements of our students in the Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences. In partnership with the public, private sector and government, we provide local and global opportunities for Victorians to meaningfully engage with, and enrich the community. Selected students participate in local and overseas Model United Nations conferences, attachments with the Ministry of Defence, and joint research programmes with civic societies such as the Singapore Heritage Society. Through these opportunities, students hone their knowledge and skills.</p>

    <label for="accordion4">Innovation Programme</label>
    <div>
      <p>The MOE-organised Innovation Programme allows students to develop their problem-solving and inventive skills by coming up with innovative ideas and products. In Victoria School, students adopt the Design Thinking Framework in the identification of an authentic problem and the formulation of a novel user-centred solution. The programme culminates in the Young Innovators’ Fair, where selected participants showcase their projects.</p>

    <label for="accordion5">Malay Special Programme (MSP)</label>
    <div>
      <p>Victorians with a propensity for languages are encouraged to take up Malay language under the MOE-based Malay (Special Programme), or MSP. This third language programme has been offered to our students since 2013 and enables them to develop competence and confidence in the use of the Malay language. Through this programme, they learn to appreciate Malay traditions and culture, while making connections to their own.</p>
			<p>For ‘O’ Level Programme students who offer MSP at the national examinations and receive a pass grade, they will be able to use the grade in lieu of a Humanities subject for admission to Junior Colleges. In addition, they are given a bonus of two points in their application to a Junior College of their choice.</p>

    <label for="accordion6">Mathematics Talent Development Programme</label>
    <div>
      <p>Victorians who excel in Mathematics are encouraged to participate in mathematical research work, where they are part of a mentorship programme and are given the opportunity to explore advanced mathematical concepts. These talented students participate in the Singapore Mathematical Olympiad (SMO), which develops their thinking skills and prepares them for more advanced study of Mathematics. Under this programme, our young mathematicians not only deepen their fascination for the subject, they also represent the school at the National Mathematics Competition (Singapore Mathematics Project Festival), the pinnacle competition for Singapore students.</p>

    <label for="accordion7">VECTORS</label>
    <div>
      <p>The programme, VECTORS, is a source of great intellectual stimulation for Victorians with strong ambitions in the field of Science. It challenges and stretches students who demonstrate ability and interest in Science. Our Victorians are given access to a wide range of opportunities to learn beyond the curriculum. These learning opportunities which take them out of their classrooms include enrichment modules (at junior colleges, polytechnics and universities), research mentorships, and participation in subject-based competitions.</p>
