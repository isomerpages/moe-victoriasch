### Victoria-Cedar Alliance (VCA)

The Victoria-Cedar Alliance is made up of three schools, Victoria School, Cedar Girls’ Secondary School (CGSS) and Victoria Junior College (VJC). Since 2012, we have offered the 6-year Integrated Programme (IP) to high-ability boys and girls, where they spend 4 years in their respective secondary schools before moving to VJC for two years before attempting the GCE ‘A’ Levels. Like all brothers and sisters, we are unique and distinctive in our own ways. Bonded by a shared belief to prepare our students for the 21st century, we nurture our students to their full potential and develop every student to be a _Social Innovator, Passionate Learner_. Today the partnership extends to CCA collaborations, student leadership development and talent development so as to ensure that our students benefit from the alliance.

We warmly welcome you to embark on this exciting 6-year journey with us.
