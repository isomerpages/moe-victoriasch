			<p><h3>English</h3></p>
			<img src="/images/eldept.jpg">
		<p><h4>Philosophy</h4></p>
			<p>As lingua franca, the English Language performs a fundamental role in Education. The current realisation of the demands for the 21st Century citizen further indicates a need to make students confident speakers and communicators.<br><br>Building on the EL Syllabus 2010 objective to develop effective language use, the English Language (EL) curriculum for the ‘O’ Level and IP will further differentiate by strengthening the appreciation of the language through literature and linguistics, and the application of English through knowledge construction and discussions on issues and concepts. Meta-cognition in the form of critical thinking and reflection will be used to activate their learning.<br><br>The purpose of such differentiation is toward the engagement of high-ability students cognitively and affectively thereby cultivating a lifelong passion for the English Language. It is hoped that students will see beyond the functional usage of English and appreciate the language as a carrier of culture and meaning.</p>
		<p><h4>Teaching and Learning Model / Approach</h4></p>
		<p>The EL Programme for the ‘O’ Level and IP will adopt the Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM) to structure its learner outcomes. The model, developed by VanTassel-Baska from the College of William & Mary, emphasises on the integration of advanced content, higher order thinking processes and connections to overaching themes and issues as the foundation for curriculum development. In essence, this integrated approach to language learning will create better flow by allowing students to see language use in more authentic situations.<br><br>The school will continue to leverage on Teaching for Understanding (TfU) framework which takes from the learner outcomes derived using the ICM to design differentiated units and lesson plans for the IP. By constantly linking back to the throughlines of the units, students will focus on the understanding goals in each lesson and are guided through questions and discussions to apply their understanding through performances. They will thus make connections on all aspects of their lessons to the larger concepts and issues in the unit.</p>
			<p><h4>Learner Outcome</h4></p>
			<p>The curriculum will be structured according to the three dimensions in the ICM which inform on the learner outcomes and design of the curriculum. Equipped with higher proficiency and understanding in the language and literature, the students will then be able to leverage on EL in a professional manner in the future. In particular, students are encouraged to:</p>
			<p>(a) <b>Advanced Content Dimension</b><ul><li>Develop linguistic and oral competency</li><li>Develop literary thinking</li><li>Develop skills in giving argument and opinions</li></ul></p>
			<p>(b) <b>Process-Product Dimension</b><ul><li>Develop critical thinking and reflection</li><li>Engender collaboration and participation</li><li>Develop research skills</li></ul></p>
			<p>(c) <b>Concept Dimension</b><ul><li>Assimilate key concepts into existing structures in society and the world</li></ul></p>
			<p><h4>Assessment Plan / Assessment Framework</h4></p>
			<p>Assessment plays a key role in differentiating the curriculum for the ‘O’ Level and IP programme. The IP curriculum has greater focus on developing higher order thinking which is seen in performance tasks where students have to apply their learning in challenging and authentic tasks. The ‘O’ Level curriculum is more focused on developing Linguistic and Oral competency and is more structured in its approach to develop thinking skills.<br><br>The assessment framework follows from the three dimensions of the ICM where each dimension is assessed using a basket of formative and summative assessment modes. The use of a variety of assessment modes will allow for better matching of performance tasks with outcomes.</p>
	<p><b>Assessment modes include:</b><ul><li>Self, peer and teacher assessment</li><li>Portfolio (Oral and writing)</li><li>Journal reflection</li><li>Oral presentation</li><li>Observational checklist</li><li>Group projects</li><li>Test and examination</li></ul></p>

			<p><h3>Mathematics</h3></p>
			<img src="/images/eldept.jpg">
		<p><h4>Philosophy</h4></p>
			<p>Mathematics is an excellent vehicle for the development and improvement of a person’s intellectual competency in logical reasoning, spatial visualisation, analysis and abstract thought. Students develop numeracy, reasoning, thinking skills, and problem solving skills through the learning and application of Mathematics. These are valued not only in Science and Technology, but also in everyday living and in the workplace. The development of a highly skilled scientifically and technologically based manpower requires a strong grounding in Mathematics. An emphasis on Mathematics education will ensure that we have an increasingly competitive workforce to meet the challenges of the 21st century.<br><br>Mathematics is also a subject of enjoyment and excitement, which offers students opportunities for creative work and moments of enlightenment and joy. When ideas are discovered and insights gained, students are spurred to pursue Mathematics beyond the classroom walls.</p>
		<p><h4>Curriculum</h4></p>
		<p>By the end of the course, a student should be able to:<br><ul><li>acquire the necessary mathematical concepts and skills for everyday life, and for continuous learning in Mathematics and related disciplines.</li><li>develop the necessary process skills for the acquisition and application of mathematical concepts and skills.</li><li>develop the mathematical thinking and problem solving skills and apply these skills to formulate and solve problems.</li><li>recognise and use connections among mathematical ideas, and between Mathematics and other disciplines.</li><li>make effective use of a variety of mathematical tools (including information and communication technology tools) in the learning and application of Mathematics.</li><li>produce imaginative and creative work arising from mathematical ideas.</li><li>develop the abilities to reason logically, to communicate mathematically, and to learn cooperatively and independently.</li></ul></p>
			<p><h4>Pedagogy</h4></p>
			<p>The Mathematics Department aims to establish a high-quality Mathematics instructional programme based on a sound curriculum and pedagogy that creates thinking, IT competent and self-directed learners who appreciate interdisciplinary learning. The Department focuses on the design of engaging learning activities via the following approaches:<ul><li>Teaching for Understanding framework</li><li>Collaborative Learning Strategies</li><li>Mathematical Modeling
</li><li>Socratic Questioning</li></ul></p>
			<p><h4>Assessment</h4></p>
			<p>The Mathematic Department employs the Mastery Learning approach through regular work assignments, ongoing assessment and lesson reinforcement comprising of:</p>
	<p><ul><li>Daily written assignments</li><li>topical worksheets (differentiated)</li><li>topical class tests/quizzes</li><li>Alternative Assessment</li></ul><br>All work assignments submission are closely monitored to encourage consistent work and revision and to allow teachers to monitor the students’ progress.</p>

			<p><h3>Science</h3></p>
			<img src="/images/sciences2.jpg">
		<p><h4>Philosophy</h4></p>
			<p>Students are taught for an appreciation of the big ideas in Science and then articulate to Biology, Chemistry and Physics with increasing complexity and elaboration. It is hoped that the curriculum allows the discipline to serve as a means for furthering intellectual growth of students, and facilitating them in becoming constructive agents of change for them community and beyond.</p>
