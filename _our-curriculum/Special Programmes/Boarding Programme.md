# **Boarding Programme**

![](/images/boarding_programme.jpg)

Within our school grounds at Siglap Link is our hostel, Victoria Hall. The hostel provides accommodation for our international students. In addition, the hostel offers Victorians the unique experience of boarding in the Victorian Leadership Boarding Programme, which has been running since 2014. Every term, a selection of classes board at the Hostel to develop a keener sense of self-discipline and independence, under the guidance of our residential Teacher Mentors. During their term of stay, there are activities that build camaraderie and broaden the studentsâ€™ experiences beyond their academic studies in Victoria School.
