# **Old Victorians’ Association**

### OUR COMMUNITY

![](/images/OVA-Home-Page-Header.gif)

Established in 1941, our OVA is the platform on which Victorians stay connected, strengthen ties and actively give back to their alma mater. Nowhere does the much lauded Victorian spirit manifest itself more evidently than in the OVA’s desire to nurture, support and inspire the next generations of Victorians. By actively participating in current programmes run by VS, the Old Victorians inculcate in young Victorians their deep attachment to their school, and with the belief that one never leaves Victoria. The alumni of Victoria have established a presence in multifarious professions, institutions and industries. They support the young Victorians by organising networking activities and creating opportunities for the latter to experience the ‘real world’. In addition, the care and concern Old Victorians have for young Victorians is expressed in financial support, being sponsors of a range of scholarships, bursaries and awards. Once a Victorian, always a Victorian.
