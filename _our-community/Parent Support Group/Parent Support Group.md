# **Parent Support Group**

Dear Parents,

On behalf of the Victoria School Parent Support Group, a warm welcome to everyone to the Victoria School Community.

Please allow me to introduce you to our parent group. Our vision is to be a valued partner in the well beings and developments of the Victorians, working in close rapport with the school. This comes with our mission to partner with the school in bringing the best out of every Victoria and to continue to the perpetuation of the special Victorian spirit.

VSPSG is a society registered with the Registrar of Societies (ROS) since Year 2000 and it runs entirely by a group of parent volunteers. The operation of VSPSG is governed by a constitution. The committee organises events throughout the year to equip parents with family life skills for the well- being and development of our Victorians.

With the VSPSG funds, we have sponsored academic improvement awards for our Victorians, and supported some of the school's other activities. We hope you can join us as a member, and volunteer your time or expertise to enrich the boys' secondary school education at VS. A non-refundable membership entrance fee of $40 is collected to help fund the various VSPSG organized events.

Nil Sine Labore

Warmest regards,  
Patsy Lee  
Chairman
