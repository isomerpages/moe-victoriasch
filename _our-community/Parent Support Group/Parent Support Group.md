Dear Parents,

On behalf of the Victoria School Parent Support Group, a warm welcome to everyone to the Victoria School Community.

Please allow me to introduce you to our Parent Support Group. Our vision is to be a valued partner in the well-being and development of the Victorians, working in close rapport with the school. This comes with our mission to partner with the school to bring out the best of every Victorian and to perpetuate the special Victorian spirit.

The next 4 years of your son’s secondary school life will no doubt be a key milestone in their journey of discovery and growth. In the blink of an eye, the son you see today will bloom into a young gentleman whom you will be proud of.

As a parent, we would also want to play a pivotal role in our sons’ development and witness their growth in partnership with the school. VS is always doing its utmost to ensure our sons are developing holistically and providing the platform for them to find their own potential. The work that we are doing in VSPSG will definitely go a long way to help support this meaningful cause.

The VSPSG is run entirely by a group of parent volunteers and funded by your one-time membership fee of $50 per parent. With the VSPSG funds, we have supported some of the school’s activities during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Teacher’s Day Celebration as well as our boys during the GCE O level result day, Graduation Day and Graduation Night. We hope that you can join us as a member, and volunteer your time or expertise to enrich the boys' secondary school education at VS.

We will start the year with our tradition Coffee Talk, "Transiting Your Child into Victoria School”, organised exclusively for our PSG members whose children are starting Sec/Year 1. This session encompasses a series of briefing/sharing, including CyberWellness, Emotional Support and Educational Needs and Support, by various key personnel of the school who will be directly involved in your son’s school life during his time in VS. Some of the speakers include Principal/Vice Principal, School Counsellors. The talk will be held on **Thursday, 29th January 2025, 9.30am-12:30pm at Victoria School or through a zoom session (if you are unable to attend the talk at Victoria School)**. Refreshments will be served for those coming to Victoria School to attend the talk. You can take this opportunity to mingle with other parents. To attend the coffee talk session, do sign up for the VSPSG membership and register for the talk via this link - [https://forms.gle/zBWbxQQxCjZnZBs58](https://forms.gle/zBWbxQQxCjZnZBs58).

Coming up during the first weekend of March school holiday (13-14 March, Friday-Saturday), VSPSG will be organizing our signature 2D1N Parent and Son Bonding Camp in school. For our planning purposes, we would appreciate it if you could indicate your interest in attending the camp via this link - [https://forms.gle/BLpYgm31pM9q7DBT6](https://forms.gle/BLpYgm31pM9q7DBT6). We will be sending the official sign-up form through Parent Gateway in Feb.
