Dear Parents,

On behalf of the Victoria School Parent Support Group, a warm welcome to everyone to the Victoria School Community.

Please allow me to introduce you to our Parent Support Group. Our vision is to be a valued partner in the well-being and development of the Victorians, working in close rapport with the school. This comes with our mission to partner with the school to bring out the best of every Victorian and to perpetuate the special Victorian spirit.

The next 4 years of your son’s secondary school life will no doubt be a key milestone in their journey of discovery and growth. What you see in your son today, will soon blossom into a gentleman whom you will be proud of in a blink of an eye.

As a parent, we would also want to play a pivotal role in our sons’ development and witness their growth in partnership with the school. VS is always doing its utmost to ensure our sons are developing holistically and providing the platform for them to find their own potential. The work that we are doing in VSPSG will definitely go a long way to help support this meaningful cause.

The VSPSG is run entirely by a group of parent volunteers and funded by your one-time membership fee of $50. With the VSPSG funds, we have supported some of the school’s activities during Chinese New Year, Hari Raya and Teacher’s Day Celebration and also supported our boys during the GCE O level result day, Graduation Day and Graduation Night. We hope you can join us as a member, and volunteer your time or expertise to enrich the boys' secondary school education at VS.

We will start the year with our tradition Coffee Talk, "Transiting Your Child into Victoria School”, organized exclusively for our PSG members whose child is starting Sec/Year 1. This session encompasses a series of briefing/sharing, including CyberWellness, Emotional Support and Educational Needs and Support, by various key personnel of the school who will be directly involved in your son’s school life during his time in VS. Some of the speakers include Principal/Vice Principal, School Counsellor. The talk will be held on **Thursday, 23rd January 2025, 9.30am-12pm at Victoria School or through zoom session (if you are unable to attend the talk at Victoria School)**. Refreshment will be served for those coming to Victoria School to attend the talk. To attend the coffee talk session, do sign up for VSPSG membership and register for the talk in this link - [https://forms.gle/Hs7RmGvrbFZQdcou9](https://forms.gle/Hs7RmGvrbFZQdcou9) .

Coming up on the first weekend of Mar school holiday, VSPSG is organizing a 2D1N Parent and Son Bonding Camp in school. Do lookout for the signup form in Feb.
