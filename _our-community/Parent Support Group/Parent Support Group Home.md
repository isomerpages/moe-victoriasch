Dear Parents,

On behalf of the Victoria School Parent Support Group, a warm welcome to everyone to the Victoria School Community.

Today marks another new milestone in your son's life after PSLE.

Please allow me to introduce you to our parent group. Our vision is to be a valued partner in the well beings and developments of the Victorians, working in close rapport with the school. This comes with our mission to partner with the school in bringing the best out of every Victoria and to continue to the perpetuation of the special Victorian spirit.

The next 4 years of your son’s secondary school life will no doubt be a key milestone in their journey of discovery and growth. What you see in your son today, will soon blossom into a gentleman whom you will be proud of in a blink of an eye.

And as a parent, I believe we will also want to play a pivotal part in our son's development and witness their growth in partnership with the school. VS is always doing its utmost to ensure our sons are developing holistically and providing the platform for them to find their own potential. The work that we are doing in VSPSG will definitely go a long way to help support that meaningful cause.

The VSPSG is run entirely by a group of parent volunteers and funded by your one-time membership fee of $40. With the VSPSG funds, we have also sponsored academic improvement awards for our Victorians, and supported some of the school's other activities. We hope you can join us as a member, and volunteer your time or expertise to enrich the boys' secondary school education at VS.

We will usually start the year with our tradition Coffee Talk, "Transiting Your Child into Victoria School”. Organized exclusively for PSG members whose child will be starting Sec/Year 1. This session encompasses a series of briefing/sharing by various key personnel of the school who will be directly involved in your son’s school life during his time in VS. Some of the speakers include Principal/Vice Principal, School Counsellor. The talk will be held on **Thursday, 19th January 2023, 9.30am-12pm**.

We will be having a hybrid session (on-site in school or via zoom).

To attend the coffee talk session, do sign up for membership and register for the talk as well May I take the opportunity to wish all of you a Happy Merry Xmas and a Happy New Year 2023.
