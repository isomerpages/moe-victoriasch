# **PSG Logo**

     style="width:25%">

The PSG Logo was created through an in-house competition in partnership with Victoria Schoolâ€™s Art Elective Programme students.

The logo shows the close partnership between parents and the school, during the developing years of the Victorian which is depicted by the tree. The leaves on the top represent the core values of the school.

PSG is very proud to adopt this logo designed by our very own Victorian who himself sees the importance of the tripartite relationship amongst Parents, School and Students during their formative years at Victoria School.
