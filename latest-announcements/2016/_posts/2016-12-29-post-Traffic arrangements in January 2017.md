**To: Victorians and Parents**

**30 December 2016**

**Traffic arrangements in January 2017**

1\.  As the school term starts, with effect from **3 January 2017**, there will be traffic re-direction within the school compound. Refer to **Map I**

Dry weather

2\.  On days with good weather, as per current arrangement, parents’ vehicles will not be allowed to enter the school campus to drop off their son. This is to ensure safety of our Victorians students who are walking into the school.

3\.  **For students who take their parents’ car to school**, they should alight outside the current Main Gate and Gate 1 at Siglap Link. Do note that Siglap Link is very narrow, compared to pre-construction days.

4\.  After being dropped off, Victorians could walk and enter the school via the current Main Gate (where there is a pedestrian side road).

5\.  For **students who take bus to school**, they should enter the school via Side Gate A. An additional gate has been constructed at Side Gate A to ease human traffic during morning school hours (Mon, Tue, Wed & Fri - 6:30am to 7:35am; Thu - 7:30am to 8:35am). This gate will be manned by a school staff to ensure school security when it is open.

**Wet weather (rainy days)**

6\.  On rainy days, parents’ cars should enter via Gate 1. Parents should drop their sons at the school foyer, and exit via the Main Gate. There will be traffic directional signs to direct you. As our children study here, do drive slowly when in campus.

7\.  For **students who take bus to school**, they should enter the school via Side Gate A.
