Congratulations to our Volleyball team!

After an intense season, our C Division Volleyball team achieved National 2nd in the National School Games Volleyball Championships. This is the best performance in the team's history.

Over the past few years, it has been hard work by the teachers, coach and students. Through it all, they believed in one another, encouraged one another and never gave up.

As we always say, Nil Sine Labore. Success comes with effort. Great job done by the teachers, coach and students.

To the supporters who were at the match, you were fantastic. You impressed those present with your cheering. Well done!

Viva Victoria!
