# **NCC (Sea) National Canoe Slalom Championships – 3 Golds and 1 Silver**

![](/images/NCC-SEA-09.jpg)

Congratulations to our NCC (Sea) unit that won 3 golds and 1 silver at the National Canoe Slalom Championships held yesterday.

Our cadets trained hard for the competition. It was a race against time as the cadets competed to complete the given obstacle course in the shortest time. The cadets had to drift and control the kayak/canoe and pass through all the twelve checkpoints. For all the students who took part, you had grown in skills, water confidence and maturity. We hope you had fun and learnt from the process. All the best in the upcoming competition!

Thank you to all teachers and students who were there to support our Victorians. Your presence mean a lot to the students.

Viva Victoria.
