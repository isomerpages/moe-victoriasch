# **Red Cross Excellent Unit Competition Gold – 10th consecutive year**

Our Red Cross unit has achieved the Gold Award for the Excellent Unit Competition for Assessment Year 2016. This is the 10th consecutive Gold award.

Well done, Victorians! We are proud of you. Your hard work have led to the excellent results. Continue to aim high and work hard as a team. Teamwork is essential to success. Keep our school flag unfurled.

We would also like to thank our teachers-in-charge, alumni, voluntary adult leaders, parents and partners for the support. Your support is important to the unit's success.

Nil Sine Labore.
