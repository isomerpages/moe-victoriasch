# **Boys’ Brigade – Best Seniors’ Programme Company**

In addition to achieving the 19th consecutive Gold award for the J M Fraser Award for Excellence, our Boys' Brigade Company, the 2nd Singapore Company, has been awarded the Best Seniors' Programme Company.

Over the past few years, our Boys' Brigade has put in place processes and programmes to enhance administrative and operational efficiency of the unit, and to enhance members' development and passion. The award of the Best Seniors Programme Company is an affirmation of the great work done.

Congratulations to our BB company! Well done and great job! We are proud of you.

A big thank you to the teachers-in-charge, alumni, voluntary adult leaders, alumni and parents for the strong support and guidance of our BB members. Today's success is the result of everyone's hard work.

Nil Sine Labore.
