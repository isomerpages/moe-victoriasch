Boys' Brigade: J M Fraser Gold Award

Our Boys' Brigade (BB), 2nd Singapore Company, has achieved the Gold Award for the J M Fraser Award for Excellence, given out in recognition of the BB companies' achievements in the areas of administrative and operational efficiency. This is the 19th Gold Award.

Well done, Victorians! We are proud of you. Your hard work have led to the excellent results. Teamwork is essential to success. Continue to aim high and work hard as a team. Do your individual and team best in every endeavour. Keep our school flag unfurled.

We would also like to thank our teachers-in-charge, alumni, voluntary adult leaders, parents and partners for the support. Your support is important to the unit's success.

Nil Sine Labore.
