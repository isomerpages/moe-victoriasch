We are C Division National 2nd and B Division National 4th for Cross Country!

To prepare for the Championships, our B and C Division teams trained hard and improved on their skills and techniques. They were receptive to feedback from their teachers and coaches, and did their best to improve. Today, they gave their best and ran the best race of the season.

Congratulations, Victorians! We are proud of you. Your hard work paid off. Continue to work hard for the National Track &Â Field events you are involved in. Apply your learning to life and you will excel as a person.

We also congratulate Cedar Girls' Secondary School for clinching C Division Champions and 3rd for B Division, and VJC for achieving A Division 4th for boys and 2nd for girls. Thank you for cheering our VS teams too!

Nil Sine Labore.
