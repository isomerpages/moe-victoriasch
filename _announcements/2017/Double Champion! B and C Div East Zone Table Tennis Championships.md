Double Champion!

Great news! We are Zonal double Champions for B and C Division Table Tennis!

Our Victorians played with confidence and showed great composure and consistency. It was a close fight between the competing teams. A well-deserved victory for both teams! Congratulations, Victorians!

Thank you to the student leaders, students, parents and teachers who came to support. Your cheering powered the teams to victory.

We also congratulate Cedar Girls' Secondary School for clinching 3rd position and champions in their B and C Division zonal tournament respectively! Thank you to the Cedarians for cheering our VS teams too!

All the best to our VCA teams in the upcoming National tournament!

Nil Sine Labore!
