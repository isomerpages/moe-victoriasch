Congratulations to our AEP boys Banyan Hee Jia Rui (3B) and Brian Cheng Yew Way (3B) for being the youngest finalists in the inaugural Sovereign Art Charity Students Prize, Singapore 2017!

At the recently concluded Singapore Contemporary 2017, their works that were done in 2016 when they were in Secondary 2 were exhibited alongside artworks done by JC and tertiary art schools students.

We hope that this is just the start of many more inspiring artworks to come from both Banyan and Brian!
