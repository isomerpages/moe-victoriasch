The 2017 NPCC Annual Parade was held today at the Home Team Academy. The school was presented with the Gold award for the Unit Overall Proficiency Award (UOPA) and the Unit Excellence Award for sustaining 17 years of Gold standard!

This sustained achievement is only made possible because of the hard work, strong resilience and close collaborations of the generations of students, teachers, cadet inspectors, alumni and parents.

Thank you to all who have contributed to the unit's success. Congratulations and well done, Victorians!

Nil Sine Labore.
