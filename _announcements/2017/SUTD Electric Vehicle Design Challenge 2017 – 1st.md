At the SUTD Electric Vehicle Design Challenge today, the Victoria-Cedar Alliance (VCA) team consisting of VS, Cedar and VJC students achieved 1st place. Well done, everyone! We are proud of you. We hope the knowledge, values and skills you learn will last a lifetime.

We would like to thank all teachers and staff involved for their guidance and support, including the many late nights guiding the team to assemble the car and trouble shooting the problems encountered. You helped to bring the textbook concepts alive for our students.

Nil Sine Labore.
