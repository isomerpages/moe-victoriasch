At Red Cross Youth's World Red Cross Day celebrations at the Sports Hub this afternoon, our Red Cross Unit was presented with the Excellent Unit Award. This is the 10th consecutive year the unit has achieved the Gold Award.

Chua Zen Khoon (4B) was also presented with the Director's Award, the highest honour a Red Cross cadet can achieve in the secondary level.

Congratulations to our Red Cross Unit! Victorians, we are proud of you. Continue to improve and strive for excellence. Be disciplined, focus on your goals and targets, follow your plans, and do your best in every endeavour. Keep VS' flag unfurled.

A big thank you to the teachers-in-charge, alumni, voluntary adult leaders for the unstinting guidance and support. Thank you to all parents for supporting your sons in their CCA.

Nil Sine Labore.
