# **East Zone Badminton Championship – (B Div -3rd) / (C Div – Champion)**

![](/images/1-2.jpg)

After an exciting season, the East Zone B and C Division Badminton Championships came to an end today.

We are proud that our B and C Division teams achieved 3rd and 1st respectively. The hard work paid off, and our teams improved on their performance from 2016. We wish our B and C Division Badminton teams all the best in the National Round.

As the East Zone Badminton Convenor, we would also like to thank all East Zone participating schools for their support and co-operation. Through sports, character and friendships are forged. We hope everyone found the season meaningful and enriching. To all the Zonal Top 4 teams, all the best in the National Round.

A big thank you to the teachers, staff, students of the B and C Division Badminton team, and all student and staff helpers, for the successful organisation of the Zonal Championships. Without you, the games would not be possible.

Nil Sine Labore.
