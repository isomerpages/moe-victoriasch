Zonal 4th!

We are Zonal 4th for the East Zone B Division Volleyball Championship.

It was a close match between Dunman Sec and VS today. Our Victorians gave their best and persevered to the very end. We are proud to see the great teamwork and the strong fighting spirit to the very end. Congratulations!

We would like to thank the teachers-in-charge, coaches and supporters for the great support.

To the team, continue to train, learn and improve. All the best for the National Round. Come back stronger and go all the way! Keep VS' flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore.
