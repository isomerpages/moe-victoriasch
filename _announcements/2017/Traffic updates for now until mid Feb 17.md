# **\* Traffic updates for now until mid Feb 17**

Please note that the existing traffic arrangement remains, as approvals have not been obtained from the relevant authorities to use the new Gate 2 (leading to Marine Parade Road) and Side-Gate B (opposite Mandarin Gardens).

For Victorians who take the bus to school, they should enter the school via **_Side Gate A_**.

In **dry weather**, parents who drive their sons to school should drop their sons along Siglap Link **before** _**Gate 1**_. These Victorians should then enter the campus via the pedestrian walkway alongside the Gate 1 and follow the pedestrian crossing and footprints to enter the school building. (Note: The pedestrian walkway alongside Main Gate is closed from 9 Jan 2017).

In **wet weather** (when it is raining), parents’ cars should **enter** via **_Gate 1_**.  Parents should drop their sons at the school foyer, and **exit** via the **_Main Gate_**. 

For parents who drive, please drive slowly and follow the directions from our traffic marshals.  

Thank you.
