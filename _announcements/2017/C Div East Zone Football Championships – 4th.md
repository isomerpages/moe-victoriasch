Our C Division Football team played against Tanjong Katong Secondary School today in the zonal 3rd / 4th placing match.

Our team played their hearts out, defended well and showed much teamwork throughout the game. Despite their valiant efforts, we lost the match 0-1 to our opponents and clinched the zonal 4th position.

We are proud of how you played the game this season. Great effort and teamwork by everyone. All the best for the national competition in July!

Nil Sine Labore.
