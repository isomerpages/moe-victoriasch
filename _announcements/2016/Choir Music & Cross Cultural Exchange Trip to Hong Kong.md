During the Choir Music & Cross Cultural Exchange Trip to Hong Kong (27-30 Nov), our Choir achieved the Gold Award and Champion for the Equal Voices (Senior Youth) Category. Well done, Victorians! Congratulations!

As part of the trip, our VS Choir also had the chance to learn from other choirs, masterclasses, and workshops. In addition, they visited Wah Yan College Kowloon and exchanged pointers with the students there. We hope the cross cultural learning was useful.

Nil Sine Labore. Viva Victoria!
