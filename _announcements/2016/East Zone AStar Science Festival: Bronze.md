# **East Zone A\*Star Science Festival – Bronze**

Congratulations to Suresh Rubesh (4I), Ivan Feng (4J), Syed Wazir (4K) and Wayne Yeo (4K)!

Their project won the Bronze award at the 2016 East Zone A\*Star Science Festival. Their research on affordable remotely operated underwater vehicle allows us to better monitor the condition of our school pond, which is an important aquatic habitat.

Well done, Victorians! You have worked hard to come up with the prototype and to improve on it over the holidays and past few weeks. It was really a labour of love. Your achievement bears testimony to the importance of hard work.

Viva Victoria!
