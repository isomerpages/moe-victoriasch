# **VS140 Dinner – Alumni Montage**

Dear Victorians

We are putting together a list of Victorians who have made tangible contributions to the work, community and nation.

For the VS140 Gala Dinner, a montage will be created and shown as part of pre-dinner and dinner proceedings. For future school events and programmes, we will also invite more of our alumni to come back and share with their juniors. We will also interview distinguished alumni from different professions for future editions of school publication.

Please provide the details by Wed, 14 Sep.  Here is the link to the form – [http://tinyurl.com/vsalumniform](http://tinyurl.com/vsalumniform)

We hope our efforts to showcase our Victorians who have done well will inspire our younger Victorians to follow in their seniors’ footsteps and keep our Victorian flag unfurled.

Nil Sine Labore. Viva Victoria!

Yours Sincerely,    
Lim Boon Kong Andrew   
Principal, Victoria School
