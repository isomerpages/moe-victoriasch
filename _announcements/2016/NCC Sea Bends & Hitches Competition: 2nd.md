# **NCC Sea Bends & Hitches Competition: 2nd**

![](/images/01-8.jpg)

Our NCC Sea Unit achieved 2nd in the Bends & Hitches Competition.

The competition took on a new format this year. It was a situational exercise that required the cadets to apply what they have learnt. In addition, the cadets were tested on their theory and knowledge. Our Victorians did their best and learnt from the experience. Congratulations and well done!

Continue to excel and keep our flag unfurled!

Viva Victoria!
