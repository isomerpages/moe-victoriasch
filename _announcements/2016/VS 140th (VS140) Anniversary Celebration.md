Dear Alumni,

**VS 140th (VS140) Anniversary Celebration:**  
**140th Anniversary Gala Dinner** **on Saturday, 17 September 2016, 6.00pm -10.00pm**

**Background**

1.   The vision of Victoria School is to develop every Victorian into a Gentleman, Professional and Sportsman who makes tangible contributions to his family, work, community and nation. Established in 1876, Victoria School (VS) is known for her strong school spirit, rich traditions and for providing a broad-based holistic education.

2.   In 2016, VS celebrates 140 years of school history. The theme for the school’s 140th Anniversary Celebrations is “Viva Victoria”. Taken from one of the school cheers, the theme signifies vibrancy and dynamism. It represents the life and energy of the school in continuously grooming Victorians into Gentlemen, Professionals and Sportsmen.

**VS140 fund-raising**

3.   To nurture our next generation of Victorians, we aim to provide a high-quality learning education and environment that is accessible to all students, regardless of family background.

4.   As part of our 140th anniversary celebration, the school aims to raise funds for scholarship, bursaries, financial assistance and repair/maintenance of non-standard facilities. The funds raised will ensure that a high-quality education at VS remains accessible to all students, regardless of family backgrounds.

**Donation towards VS140 Fund Raising**

5.   The VS 140th Anniversary Gala Dinner will be a grand occasion for alumni to gather for a time of reunion and celebration. The Guest-of-Honour for the event is Mr Ng Chee Meng, Acting Minister for Education (Schools).

6.   Donations of $100 and above are entitled to tax exemption and tax-exempt receipts will be issued. As a gesture of appreciation, every donor who donates at least $1500 will be given one table (10 person) \[refer to table below\]. The food is halal-certified Chinese banquet menu. Allocation of seats/tables is on a first-come-first-served basis. For the recent batches of Victorians (Class of 2007 to 2015) who are still studying, the tables are available at $250 for 10 persons. This special rate is made possible by the generous sponsorship of older alumni members and to encourage the younger alumni to join in the festivities of the Gala Dinner.
