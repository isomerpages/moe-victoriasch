# **Appeal for Primary 6 students for Admission to 2017 Secondary 1**

Primary 6 students who have applied to Victoria School during MOE’s Secondary 1 Posting Exercise but are unsuccessful, may appeal to be considered for transfer to Victoria School.

The students applying for school transfer to VS after the release of the Secondary 1 Posting result have to meet the school’s cut-off points (COP) for the O Level or Integrated Programme.

For your convenience, it is not necessary to submit any hardcopy appeal form personally. Please **apply online from 21 December (0900 hrs) to 23 December (1700 hrs).** An **Application Reference Number** will be issued when application is submitted successfully. Late application will not be considered and only shortlisted applicants will be informed.

Please refer to this [**link**](https://victoria.moe.edu.sg/admissions/sec-1-year-1-admission-via-psle-results/appeal-for-p6-students/) for more information on the appeal process.

**Pending the outcome of appeal, all applicants are required to report to the school that they are posted to by the Ministry of Education on Secondary 1 Registration Day on Thursday, 22 December, 8.30am.**  VS will assist to facilitate the transfer process if the applicant is eventually successful.

Successful applicants will be informed by 31 December. The decision of the Admissions Committee is final and the school will not enter into discussion with the applicants regarding its decision.

Thank you.
